A comrade from years ago, now living in Bangkok, sends  this address, really a prayer, that puts the day we honor our heroes in perspective. It was  delivered at the close of World War II , on an island that saw some of the fiercest fighting of that terrible war. The message is timeless. Jack Rains Houston *************************************************************************************************************************************************** 14 March 1945    U.S. Marine Corps, 5th Division, Cemetery, Iwo Jima Composed and delivered by Rabbi R. B. Gittlesohn, Chaplain, U.S.M.C. This is perhaps the grimmest, and surely the holiest, task we have faced since D-Day. Before us lie the bodies of comrades and friends. Men, who until yesterday or last week, laughed with us, trained with us, men who were on the same ships with us, and went over the sides with us as we prepared to hit the beaches on this island, men who fought with us and feared with us. Somewhere in this plot of ground there may lie the man who could have discovered the cure for cancer. Under one of these Christian Crosses, or beneath a Jewish Star of David, there may rest now a man who was destined to be a great prophet ... to find the way, perhaps, for all to live in plenty. Now they lie here silently in this sacred soil, and we gather to consecrate this earth in their memory. To speak in memory of such men as these is not easy. Of them, too, can it be said with utter truth: \"The world will little note nor long remember what we say here. It can never forget what they did here.\" These men have done their job well. They have paid the ghastly price of freedom. If that freedom be once again lost, as it was after the last war, the unforgivable blame will be our, not theirs. So it is we, the living, who are here to be dedicated and consecrated. We dedicate ourselves, first, to live together in peace the way they fought and are buried in this war. Here lie men who loved America because their ancestors generations ago helped in her founding, and other men who loved her with equal passion, because they themselves or their fathers escaped from oppression to her blessed shores. Here lie officer and men, Blacks and Whites, Protestants and Catholics and Jews, together. Here no man prefers another because of his faith or despises him because of his color. Any man among us, the living, who fails to understand that, will thereby betray those who lie here dead. To this, then, as our solemn, sacred duty, do we the living now dedicate ourselves: To the right of Protestants, Catholics and Jews, of White and Black men alike, to enjoy the democracy for which all of them have here paid the price. To one thing more do we consecrate ourselves in memory of those who sleep beneath these crosses and stars. This war, with all its frightful heartache and suffering, is but the beginning of our generation's struggle for democracy. When the last battle has been won, there will those at home, as there were last time, who will want us to turn our backs in selfish isolation on the rest of organized humanity, and thus to sabotage the very peace for which we fight. We promise to you who lie here: We will not do that! When the last shot has been fired, there will still be those whose eyes are turned backward, not forward, who will be satisfied with those wide extremes of poverty and wealth in which the seeds of another war can be sown. We promise you, our departed comrades: This, too, we will not permit. This war has been fought by the common man! We promise, by all that is sacred and holy, that your sons, the sons of miners and millers, the sons of farmers and workers, will inherit from your death the right to a living that is decent and secure. Thus do we memorialize those who, having ceased living with us, now live within us. Thus do we consecrate ourselves, the living, to carry on the struggle they began. Too much blood has gone into this soil for us to let it lie barren. Too much pain and heartache have fertilized the earth on which we stand. We here solemnly swear: This shall not be in vain! Out of this, and from the suffering and sorrow of those we mourn, this will come, we promise, the birth of a new freedom for the sons of men everywhere. Amen     Jack Rains"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Subject Line: \"Memorial Day Reflection: Honoring Our Fallen Heroes and Their Legacy\""}]}

The film opens to a child reading a comic book about the Daily Planet, the largest newspaper in the city of Metropolis. As the child reads the shot fades to the Daily Planet and up into the sky. The following title sequence moves through space and eventually reveals the planet Krypton, the home world of a highly-evolved race resembling humans and bearing a unique molecular density and structure, a result of the planet's gravitational strength and the radiation of its adjacent red sun. The planet is ruled by a Council of Elders, each representing a particular \"clan\" and bearing a crest of that particular House. The planet's greatest scientist, Jor, bears an S-shaped crest, the House of El. Jor-El is supervising the trial of three criminals caught attempting to overthrow the planet's government - General Zod, the planet's former defense chief; his henchman Non, a hulking killer unable to speak; and Ursa, a woman determined to exterminate men other than the man she loves, Zod. As the elders render a guilty verdict, Zod notes that the verdict must be unanimous, so Jor-El ultimately holds the key to their fate. Despite his disillusionment with the Council of Elders, Jor-El renders a conviction. The vast dome of the planet's capital city opens to the night, and a small extra-dimensional prison - the Phantom Zone - tumbles out of the sky and pulls the three criminals out of the trial room and into an eternity in dimensional limbo through space. While a frightened Ursa begs for forgiveness, Zod defiantly swears that he will have his vengeance on the House of El, even if it takes him a thousand years.However, Jor-El's more pressing concern lies in the orbital shift of Krypton; this shift is putting the planet into the fatal gravitational pull of its central star, a fact blithely ignored by the Council Of Elders. The leader of the Council forbids Jor-El from warning the larger populace or he will be imprisoned in the Phantom Zone...\nAnswer:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The Fortress of Solitude is a fictional location in the DC Comics universe, specifically in the Superman mythos.

Article: Beach volleyball  is one of those sports that can be an exciting game to play and watch. It's really easy, and all you need is sand, a net and a group of people, of any age or fitness level, who want to have fun. Beach volleyball can be played with as few as two people in each team, making a total of four people. However, if you are less skilled and experienced in the game, it will be easier to play with a larger team. The more players you have, the less ground each person will be responsible for covering and the more time they will have to recover between shots. If you only have a few players, each of you will get a lot of running for the ball after each volley  . If you are looking for a relaxing, fun, low-key experience, choose larger teams. Beach volleyball is similar to regular volleyball in its rules. However, even experienced volleyball players do not realize how much more difficult it is to run and jump on sand. Since it is harder to move quickly on sand than a hard surface, play will be much slower than regular volleyball on a court. When an athlete trains for beach volleyball, he will focus on building lower body strength as well as upper body strength. Strengthening his legs is extremely important. This improves the player's ability to move quickly and accurately on sand despite the resistance. The ability to jump high and land without injury is necessary for beach volleyball players. Whether you are in it for the competition, or just to have a great time with your friends, beach volleyball can be extremely exciting and fun. You may start out with friends and may soon fall in love with the sport. Question: When playing beach volleyball, in which of the following situation will you feel most relaxed?

He captained the Indian team in six ODIs from late-2010 to late-2011 with India winning all six matches.\n\nGambhir scored two successive double-hundreds in 2002 (one of them against the visiting Zimbabweans) made him a strong contender for India's opening slot in all three forms of the game. He made his ODI debut against Bangladesh in the TVS Cup in 2003. In his third match, he scored 71 and was named Man of the Match. His maiden century (103 off 97 balls) came against Sri Lanka in 2005. In 2004, he made his Test debut against Australia in the fourth and last Test match of the Border Gavaskar Trophy but did himself no favours by getting out for 3 and 1. He made amends in his second Test, however, scoring 96 against the South Africans. His maiden Test century came against Bangladesh in December 2004. Gambhir then made a number of starts in the home series against Pakistan in 2005, but was able to make only one half-century in six innings. He made 97 in Zimbabwe later that year, but failed to reach 30 against Sri Lanka at home, repeatedly struggling against Chaminda Vaas, and was subsequently dropped from the Test team. He was replaced in Tests by Wasim Jaffer, who made a double hundred and a hundred in seven Tests.  While Gambhir was out of the Test team, he played a number of One Day Internationals for India between 2005 and 2007. However, he was not selected for the 2007 World Cup as the selectors opted for a top-order of Sourav Ganguly, Virender Sehwag, and Sachin Tendulkar. It affected him badly and Gambhir later said that \"When I got dropped for the World Cup, there were times I didn't want to play anymore. I didn't want to practise. I couldn't motivate myself.\" With no other career options, Gambhir stuck with cricket. After India's first-round exit from the tournament, Gambhir was selected for the One Day International on India's 2007 tour of Bangladesh. Believing the series could be his last chance, Gambhir scored his second century on that tour and was subsequently selected for the One Day International on India's tour to Ireland in 2007. He scored an unbeaten 80 against Ireland in the first game of that tour and was awarded the man of the match award for that effort. In the post-match interview, he indicated that performing more consistently was a top priority for his career as he had done so in the past.  Gambhir was selected in India's squad for the 2007 ICC World Twenty20, which India went on to win in South Africa, beating Pakistan in the final. Gambhir performed well in the shortest form of the game, ending the tournament as India's top run scorer, with 227 at an average of 37.83, including three half-centuries which included a crucial 75 runs off 54 balls against Pakistan in the final.\n\nEntity:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The entity this text is about is Gautam Gambhir, an Indian cricketer who played all formats of the game."}]}

The land that the station and garage is built upon is coveted by businessman Victor Hazell (Robbie Coltrane), who owns the surrounding land and lives in a large mansion several miles away. He attempts to buy the Smiths' land, but William turns down his offers. Used to getting his own way, he begins a campaign of harassment, trying to force them off their land.

Afterwards, he reveals that he was out poaching. A while afterwards, William informs Danny that he will be going out poaching again at night. Danny wakes up during the night, detects his absence (he had promised to be back three hours before), and decides to go and look for him. He heads for the forest at the wheel of a vintage Austin Seven that William had been repairing, but on the way there he passes a police car, which turns around to pursue him after the officers realized that the car was being driven by an underage driver.

How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect\nAnswer:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The use of barrier methods of birth control, such as condoms, does not have a direct impact on the turbine spins. The turbine spins are primarily influenced by the wind passing through the turbines and moving the blades. The barrier methods of birth control are used to prevent the fertilization of an egg by sperm, which is a completely separate process from the operation of a wind turbine.\n\nHowever, it is essential to consider the potential indirect effects that the use of barrier methods of birth control might have on the turbine spins. For instance, if the wind turbine is located in an area with a high population density, the use of barrier methods of birth control could potentially lead to a decrease in the number of people who might be able to conceive and reproduce. This could, in turn, have a slight impact on the local population dynamics, which could indirectly affect the turbine spins.\n\nIn the second effect mentioned, the spinning of the rotor in the core generates electricity. The use of barrier methods of birth control does not directly influence this process. The spinning of the rotor in the core is determined by the connection between the shaft and the generator, as well as the design of the rotor and the core. The use of barrier methods of birth control does not affect these factors, so the supposed perturbation has no effect on the second effect mentioned.\n\nIn conclusion, the use of barrier methods of birth control does not have a direct impact on the turbine spins. However, it is essential to consider the potential indirect effects that the use of barrier methods of birth control might have on the turbine spins, such as changes in the local population dynamics.

The Hamburg group shared the anti-U.S. fervor of the other candidates for the operation, but added the enormous advantages of fluency in English and familiarity with life in the West, based on years that each member of the group had spent living in Germany. Not surprisingly, Mohamed Atta, Ramzi Binalshibh, Marwan al Shehhi, and Ziad Jarrah would all become key players in the 9/11 conspiracy. Mohamed Atta was born on September 1, 1968, in Kafr el Sheikh, Egypt, to a middle-class family headed by his father, an attorney. After graduating from Cairo University with a degree in architectural engineering in 1990, Atta worked as an urban planner in Cairo for a couple of years. In the fall of 1991, he asked a German family he had met in Cairo to help him continue his education in Germany. They suggested he come to Hamburg and invited him to live with them there, at least initially. After completing a course in German, Atta traveled to Germany for the first time in July 1992. He resided briefly in Stuttgart and then, in the fall of 1992, moved to Hamburg to live with his host family. After enrolling at the University of Hamburg, he promptly transferred into the city engineering and planning course at the Technical University of Hamburg-Harburg, where he would remain registered as a student until the fall of 1999. He appears to have applied himself fairly seriously to his studies (at least in comparison to his jihadist friends) and actually received his degree shortly before traveling to Afghanistan. In school, Atta came across as very intelligent and reasonably pleasant, with an excellent command of the German language. When Atta arrived in Germany, he appeared religious, but not fanatically so. This would change, especially as his tendency to assert leadership became increasingly pronounced. According to Binalshibh, as early as 1995 Atta sought to organize a Muslim student association in Hamburg. In the fall of 1997, he joined a working group at the Quds mosque in Hamburg, a group designed to bridge the gap between Muslims and Christians. Atta proved a poor bridge, however, because of his abrasive and increasingly dogmatic personality. But among those who shared his beliefs, Atta stood out as a decisionmaker. \n\nQuestion: \"Where was Mohamed Atta born and what university did he attend to get and architect degree?\"\n\nResponse: \"In Kafr el Sheikh, Cairo University\"\n\nDoes the response correctly answer the question?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "No, the response does not correctly answer the question.

As they fly to the site of the wreck, each man recalls a part of his past: Gregg remembers the avalanche caused in Europe when his H-19 Chickasaw helicopter came too close to a mountain. The avalanche subsequently buried alive the group of people whom he was attempting to rescue. The accident has since caused him to fear flying solo. Stevenson, deeply prejudiced against the Japanese, recalls the reason for his hatred: as a civilian pilot in the Philippines prior to World War II, he met and married Caroline Gordon.

Takashima, half-Polish (mother), half-Japanese (father), reminisces about his tragic love affair with Leila, an Algerian girl, when he was an Army paratrooper during World War II.

Last year the weather had been so kind,and the harvest promised to be so good,that Jalpur had been wondering whether he could sell all that he had and live with his son farther up the coast.He had been thinking about doing this for some years.It was his dearest wish to spend his last days with his son and his wife.But he would go only if he could give;he would not go if it meant taking food out of the mouths of his grandchildren.He would rather die hungry than do this. On the day when Jalpur decided that he would harvest his corn,sell it,and move up the coast,he looked out to sea and saw a huge wave,several kilometers out,advancing on the coast and on the village of Shundagarh.Within ten minutes everyone in Shundagarh would be drowned.Jalpur would have shouted,but the people were too far away to hear.He would have run down the hill,but he was too old to run.He was prepared to do anything to save the people of Shundagarh,so he...

The psychic spoke of her father's love for her and her family, and Amy felt a sense of peace wash over her.\n\nAfter the session, Amy left feeling grateful for the experience. She felt as though she had connected with her father in a way that she never thought possible. She knew that she would never forget the comfort and peace that Madame Zara had brought into her life.\n\nOn the other hand, Mary did not visit a psychic after the death of their father. She was very gullible and easily swayed by the promises of psychics and their ability to communicate with the deceased. Mary had heard stories from her friends and family members who had visited psychics, and she was eager to experience it for herself.\n\nHowever, Mary's gullibility made her hesitant to visit a psychic. She was afraid that she might be taken advantage of or that the psychic would not be able to truly communicate with her father's spirit. Mary decided to wait until she was older and more experienced before visiting a psychic.\n\nAs time passed, Mary's gullibility did not fade. She continued to be skeptical of the idea of psychics and their ability to communicate with the deceased. She never visited a psychic and instead chose to rely on her own memories and feelings to cope with the loss of her father.\n\nIn the end, Amy's decision to visit a psychic after the death of her father brought her a sense of comfort and peace that she would never forget. Meanwhile, Mary's gullibility and hesitation kept her from experiencing the same level of comfort and connection that Amy felt."}]}

The band started off as The Ronnie Drew Ballad Group, named in honour of its founding member; they subsequently renamed themselves as The Dubliners. The group line-up saw many changes over their fifty-year career. However, the group's success was centered on lead singers Luke Kelly and Ronnie Drew.\n\nDrew spent some time in Spain in his younger years where he learned to play Flamenco guitar, and he accompanied his songs on a Spanish guitar. Drew left the band in 1974 to spend more time with his family, and was replaced by Jim McCann. He returned to The Dubliners five years later, but left the group again in 1995. Ronnie Drew died at St Vincent's Private Hospital in Dublin on 16 August 2008 after a long illness. Paddy Reilly took Drew's place in 1995. Some of Drew's most significant contributions to the band are the hit single \"Seven Drunken Nights\", his rendition of \"Finnegan's Wake\", and \"McAlpine's Fusiliers\".  Luke Kelly was more of a balladeer than Drew, and he played chords on the five-string banjo. Kelly sang many defining versions of traditional songs like \"The Black Velvet Band\", \"Whiskey in the Jar\", \"Home Boys Home\"; but also Phil Coulter's \"The Town I Loved So Well\", Ewan MacColl's \"Dirty Old Town\", \"The Wild Rover\", and \"Raglan Road\", written by the famous Irish poet Patrick Kavanagh. In 1980, Luke Kelly was diagnosed with a brain tumour. Occasionally Kelly was too ill to sing though he was sometimes able to join the band for a few songs. While on tour in Germany he collapsed on stage. When Kelly was too ill to play, he was replaced by Sean Cannon. He continued to tour with the band until two months before his death. Kelly died on 30 January 1984. One of the last concerts in which he took part was recorded and released: Live in Carre, recorded in Amsterdam, Netherlands, released in 1983. In November 2004, the Dublin city council voted unanimously to erect a bronze statue of Luke Kelly. Kelly is buried in Glasnevin Cemetery in Dublin.  Ciaran Bourke was a singer, but he also played the guitar, tin whistle and harmonica. He sang many songs in Irish (\"Peggy Lettermore\", \"Preab san Ol\"). In 1974 he collapsed on stage after suffering a brain haemorrhage. A second haemorrhage left him paralysed on his left side. Bourke died in 1988. The band did not officially replace him until his death.  John Sheahan and Bobby Lynch joined the band in 1964. They had been playing during the interval at concerts, and usually stayed on for the second half of the show. When Luke Kelly moved to England in 1964, Lynch was taken on as his temporary replacement. When Kelly returned in 1965, Lynch left the band and Sheahan stayed. According to Sheahan, he was never (and still has not been) ever officially asked to join the band. Sheahan is the only member to have had a musical education. Lynch committed suicide in Dublin in 1982.\n\nAsk a question about this article."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "What were some of the significant contributions of Ronnie Drew to The Dubliners?"}]}

The village is known for its unique tradition, which has been celebrated for over 800 years.\n\nThe origins of this tradition are somewhat unclear, but it is believed to have started in the 12th century. According to local folklore, a group of pilgrims from the village of Fairlie were on their way to visit the shrine of St. Ninian in Whithorn when they were caught in a severe storm. Unable to continue their journey, they decided to spend the night in a nearby cave. The next morning, they discovered that the cave had been filled with gold coins.\n\nOver the centuries, the legend of the gold coins has evolved, and the tradition of Fairlie's \"Fair Day\" has become an integral part of the village's identity. The Fair Day is celebrated on the first Saturday of every hundredth year, and it is a time for the people of Fairlie to come together and celebrate their heritage.\n\nDuring the Fair Day, the village is transformed into a vibrant, colorful celebration. The streets are filled with parades, music, and dancing, and the villagers dress up in traditional Scottish attire. The highlight of the day is the procession of the \"Fairlie Fair Day Queen,\" who is chosen from among the village's most beautiful and talented young women. The queen is then crowned and takes part in a grand parade through the village.\n\nThe Fair Day is not just a celebration of Fairlie's history and tradition; it is also an opportunity for the village to showcase its local produce and crafts. Visitors can sample traditional Scottish dishes, such as haggis, neeps, and tatties, and purchase handmade crafts and textiles.\n\nIn conclusion, Fairlie is a unique Scottish village that celebrates its heritage and tradition through the Fair Day, which appears for only one day every one hundred years. The village's rich history and the vibrant celebration of the Fair Day make it a must-visit destination for anyone interested in Scottish culture and traditions."}]}

You can certainly follow Darwin's footsteps and enjoy a trip from four to seven days to the islands. The islands are certainly a paradise   for wildlife, as there are no natural killers on the islands and the number of boats and visitors is under government control. Though you cannot walk freely as Darwin did about 200 years ago, each day is as impressive as it could be. The most well-known animals of the Galapagos is the giant tortoise , which can be seen moving slowly around the highlands of Santa Cruz, the second largest island in the archipelago . Some of these creatures are so old that they might have been seen in their youth by Darwin himself. Despite strict control over activities and timing, your stay on the Galapagos will be remembered as a chain of incomparable pictures: diving with sea lions that swim and play within inches of you; feeling small sharks touch your feet as you swim; and, most magically, seeing a whale and her baby surface with a great breath of air. Travelling between the islands and observing the wildlife that so inspired Darwin, you will feel as though you are getting a special view of an untouched world. At night you will sleep on board the ship, leaving the wildlife in complete occupation of the islands, which are as undisturbed now as they have been since the beginning of time.

The temple guards arrest Jesus and the rest of the apostles flee.John runs and tells Jesus' mother, Mary, as well as Mary Magdalene of the arrest, and Peter follows Jesus at a distance who is severely beaten by the Temple guards on their way back to Jerusalem. At the Jewish Temple, the head priest, Caiaphas, holds a trial of Jesus over the objection of some of the other priests, who are expelled from the court. When questioned by Caiaphas whether he is the son of God, Jesus replies \"I am\". Caiaphas is horrified and tears his robes, and Jesus is condemned to death for blasphemy. Upon entering the Temple, Peter is confronted by a mob of Jewish spectators who recognize him being one of Jesus followers and confront him. Three times Peter denies knowing Jesus, but then runs away sobbing at his cowardice.Meanwhile, the remorseful Judas attempts to return the money in order have Jesus freed, but he is refused by the priests. Tormented by demons and his guilt, he flees the city and hangs himself with a rope from a dead donkey at dawn.Caiaphas brings Jesus before Pontius Pilate, the local Roman governor of Judea, to be condemned to death.

In fact, we had to borrow money to reach our destination town. Anyway, it was my husband, two boys aged four and two, and myself, seven months pregnant  , in an old Volvo station wagon. We had been driving for two days in the middle of winter (that car's heater didn't work), and we had taken a route that was very _ . There was nothing around for miles-no cars, buildings or signs of civilization. Suddenly, our car started losing power and the gauges  went all out of order. We saw a light in the distance and managed to roll to a stop in front of this property that looked like a small simple house. Our cell phones had not gotten reception for many miles, and it was freezing outside, so I didn't know if we were going to make it out of this situation alive. My husband got out of the car to see if there was something he could do to get us rolling again, but it was not looking good. A short while later, a man came out of the house and spoke with my husband a bit before inviting us all into his home. He and his wife took us in, fed us, and made us feel at home as we struggled to find some way to get to our destination, which was still a few hours' drive away. We were able to call a friend and get a ride, leaving our broken car behind, but not before the couple gave us food and water for our journey. One week later, this dear sweet couple pulled our car all the way to our place and refused to take anything in return, except for us to pay it forward-and we have, and will continue to do it forever.

I was approximately 8 years and it happened to be summer. Baseball was a true love and my brothers and friends played daily. In the summer, all we wore were cut off jeans and nothing else. I had stepped on a rusty nail and it became infected. Time for a Tetanus shot! This was a typical occurrence for us during the summer. There was only one doctor within a one hundred square mile area and his name was Doctor Brandenbury. He was a very unpleasant, elderly man that my brothers and I did not care for since he was just a mean, old bastard. So I am shuffled off to his office and of course after hearing what had a occurred and examining my foot agreed I needed the Tetanus shot. I make a very innocent request as he is about to give me the shot. Since I knew the shot would stiffen my arm and essentially cause pain I would take it in my left arm so my throwing arm would not be affected. I tried to request this from the doctor but he did not wish to hear anything from me. He said \"I don't give a fuck what arm you get it in.\" He grabbed me roughly by the right arm and used the needle like a dart and just slammed it into my arm. I had never had a problem with shots before but that REALLY hurt. I started crying. He instructed my mother \"To get me the Hell out of his office.\" Needless to say my mother never took any of us to see this old, miserable bastard again.

His father was a sharecropper named Agustin Arango, and his mother was Micaela Arambula. He grew up at the Rancho de la Coyotada, one of the largest haciendas in the state of Durango.\n\nVilla was a brilliant tactician on the battle field, which translated to political support. In 1913, local military commanders elected him provisional governor of the state of Chihuahua against the wishes of First Chief Carranza, who wished to name Manuel Chao instead.  As Governor of Chihuahua, Villa recruited more experienced generals, including Toribio Ortega, Porfirio Talamantes, and Calixto Contreras to his military staff and achieved more success than ever. Villa's secretary, Perez Rul, divided his army into two groups, one led by Ortega, Contreras, and Orestes Pereira and the other led by Talamantes and Contreras' former deputy, Severianco Ceniceros.  Villa's war tactics were studied by the United States Army and a contract with Hollywood was made whereby Hollywood would be allowed to film Villa's movements and 50% of Hollywood's profit would be paid to Villa to support the Revolution.  As governor of Chihuahua, Villa raised more money for a drive to the south against Huerta's Federal Army by various methods. He printed his own currency and decreed that it could be traded and accepted at par with gold Mexican pesos. He forced the wealthy to give loans to fund the revolutionary war machinery. He confiscated gold from several banks, and in the case of the Banco Minero he held a member of the bank's owning family, the wealthy Terrazas clan, as a hostage until the location of the bank's hidden gold reserves was revealed. He also appropriated land owned by the hacendados (owners of the haciendas) and redistributed it to the widows and family of dead revolutionaries.  Villa's political stature at that time was so high that banks in El Paso, Texas, accepted his paper pesos at face value. His generalship drew enough admiration from the U.S. military that he and Alvaro Obregon were invited to Fort Bliss to meet Brigadier General John J. Pershing. Returning to Mexico, Villa gathered supplies for a drive to the south.  With so many sources of money, Villa expanded and modernized his forces, purchasing draft animals, cavalry horses, arms, ammunition, mobile hospital facilities (railroad cars and horse ambulances staffed with Mexican and foreign volunteer doctors, known as Servicio sanitario), and other supplies, and rebuilt the railroad south of Chihuahua City. He also recruited fighters from Chihuahua and Durango and created a large army known as the Division del Norte (Division of the North), the most powerful and feared military unit in all of Mexico. The rebuilt railroad transported Villa's troops and artillery south, where he defeated the Federal Army forces in a series of battles at Gomez Palacio, Torreon, and eventually at the heart of Huerta's regime in Zacatecas.\n\nUsing a quote from the above article, answer the following question: Did he accomplish anything important as governor?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yes, as governor of Chihuahua, Villa accomplished many important things.

The basic SI unit for mass is the kilogram (kg), but smaller masses may be measured in grams (g). To measure mass, you would use a balance. In the lab, mass may be measured with a triple beam balance or an electronic balance, but the old-fashioned balance pictured below may give you a better idea of what mass is. If both sides of this balance were at the same level, it would mean that the fruit in the left pan has the same mass as the iron object in the right pan. In that case, the fruit would have a mass of 1 kg, the same as the iron. As you can see, however, the fruit is at a higher level than the iron. This means that the fruit has less mass than the iron, that is, the fruit's mass is less than 1 kg.  I am facing a new situation today: Johnathan is trying to find two blocks of wood with the same mass for a project he is working on. He doesn't have a balance, so he makes a crude one out of materials he has on hand.

Tommy returns with his friend Allen Hawes, hoping to cremate Jason's body and stop his hallucinations. At the cemetery, they dig up Jason's corpse, but seeing it causes Tommy to snap, and he stabs Jason's body with a metal fence post. As he turns his back on Jason, two lightning bolts strike the post and revive the now-undead killer. Tommy tries to light the gasoline in which he has soaked Jason, but a sudden downpour prevents it. When Hawes tries to attack Jason with a shovel, the shovel breaks on impact and his heart is punched out. Tommy makes his way to the sheriff's office, when he panics and attempts to grab weapons, it gets him put into a jail cell. His warning that Jason has returned goes unheeded by Sheriff Garris, who is aware of Tommy's mental problems and thinks he is imagining Jason. On the road, camp counselors Darren and Lizbeth get lost looking for the camp and run into Jason. After they fail trying to frighten Jason off the road, he impales them both with the metal rod that resurrected him. The next morning, Garris' daughter Megan and her friends Sissy, Cort and Lizbeth's sister Paula ask him to search for Darren and Lizbeth. Tommy warns them about Jason, but as he is now considered an urban legend they ignore the warnings, though Megan finds herself attracted to him. In the woods, Jason happens upon a corporate paintball game. He kills four of the players for their equipment and chases the fifth off into the woods. At Camp Forest Green, the kids arrive, and the teens do their best to run the camp without Darren and Lizbeth. Meanwhile, Garris decides to escort Tommy out of his jurisdiction due to his influence on his daughter. Tommy tries to make a run for Jason's grave, but finds that the caretaker had covered it up to deny responsibility for it being dug up, and Hawes' body is buried in its place.

All is going as planned until Connie's sister, Kate, her investment broker husband, Roman Craig, and their twin daughters, Mara and Cara, crash the vacation. Ghost stories at the family BBQ include one of a man-eating grizzly bear that Chet met face-to-face when he was younger. Chet says that while he and Connie were honeymooning at the same lake, he was attacked by a giant grizzly bear. When he fired at it with a shotgun, the buckshot shaved the hair off the top of the bear's head and from that day on, it was known as the \"Bald-Headed Bear\" of Claire County. After Roman pulls Chet around the lake on an impromptu water ski ride with his rented speedboat, tensions between the families erupt. Chet is ready to pack up and go home, even as his teenage son Buck tries to romance a local girl, Cammie. The budding romance goes well until Chet is challenged to eat the Old 96'er (a 96-ounce steak) at a family dinner which causes Buck to break their date. Buck tries to apologize to Cammie for being late, but Cammie refuses to speak to him. Connie and Kate bond at a local bar when the conversation drifts to Kate's challenges of being wealthy.

Later, during a thunderstorm, the twins wander off and fall into a mine shaft. Chet and Roman find them, but the claustrophobic Roman is reluctant to descend into the tiny mine shaft. After some encouragement from Chet, Roman summons up all his courage, while Chet goes in search of a rope to pull them out.

This change will take effect from midnight on Wednesday, and it will be implemented along the lines of the system that is already in place in Scotland. This article will delve into the details of the new stamp duty reform, its implications for homebuyers, and what this means for the future of the housing market in England.\n\nThe New Stamp Duty System\n\nThe new stamp duty system in England will be based on the same principles as the one currently in place in Scotland. It will be a progressive tax system, meaning that the amount of stamp duty paid by homebuyers will increase as the value of the property they are purchasing rises. This system aims to ensure that homebuyers pay a fair share of the property's value in stamp duty, rather than a flat rate fee.\n\nUnder the new system, homebuyers will only pay stamp duty on the portion of the property's value that falls within each tax band. For example, if a homebuyer purchases a property worth £250,000, they will only pay stamp duty on the portion of the property's value that falls within the tax bands. This means that they will not pay stamp duty on the first £125,700 of the property's value.\n\nThe new stamp duty system will consist of the following tax bands:\n\n1. 0% on the first £125,700 of the property's value\n2. 2% on the portion of the property's value between £125,701 and £251,600\n3. 5% on the portion of the property's value between £251,601 and £925,000\n4. 10% on the portion of the property's value between £925,001 and £1.5 million\n5. 12% on the portion of the property's value above £1.5 million\n\nImplications for Homebuyers\n\nThe new stamp duty reform is expected to have a significant impact on the housing market in England. By making home buying more affordable and accessible, the reform is likely to encourage more people to purchase properties, which could lead to an increase in demand for housing. This, in turn, could result in higher property prices and a more stable housing market.\n\nThe new system will also provide more certainty for homebuyers when it comes to the cost of their purchase. Under the previous system, homebuyers had to pay a flat rate fee based on the value of the property they were purchasing. This meant that they had to factor in an additional cost when budgeting for their purchase. The new progressive tax system will make it easier for homebuyers to plan their finances and budget for their purchase.\n\nThe new stamp duty reform is also expected to benefit first-time homebuyers, as they will only pay stamp duty on the portion of the property's value that falls within the tax bands. This means that they will not have to pay stamp duty on the entire value of the property, which could make it more affordable for them to purchase their first home.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe stamp duty reform announced by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Rishi Sunak, is a significant step towards making home buying more affordable and accessible for people in England. By implementing a progressive tax system based on the value of the property, the new reform aims to ensure that homebuyers pay a fair share of the property's value in stamp duty. This change is expected to have a positive impact on the housing market in England, by encouraging more people to purchase properties and providing more certainty for homebuyers when it comes to the cost of their purchase."}]}

In some instances, The Powhatan, may refer to one of the leaders of the people. This is most commonly the case in historical writings by the English. The Powhatans have also been known as Virginia Algonquians, as the Powhatan language is an eastern-Algonquian language also known as Virginia Algonquian.\nContext: The capital village of \"Powhatan\" was believed to be in the present-day Powhatan Hill section of the eastern part of Richmond, Virginia, or perhaps nearby in a location which became part of Tree Hill Farm.  Another major center of the confederacy about 75 miles (121 km) to the east was called Werowocomoco. It was located near the north bank of the York River in present-day Gloucester County.  Werowocomoco was described by the English colonists as only 15 miles (24 km) as the crow flies from Jamestown, but also described as 25 miles (40 km) downstream from present-day West Point, measurements which conflict with each other. In 2003 archaeologists initiated excavations at a site in Gloucester County that have revealed an extensive indigenous settlement from about 1200 (the late Woodland period) through the early Contact period. Work since then has added to their belief that this is the location of Werowocomoco. The site is on a farm bordering on Purtain Bay of the York River, about 12 nautical miles (22 km) from Jamestown. The more than 50 acres (200,000 m2) residential settlement extends up to 1,000 feet (300 m) back from the river. In 2004, researchers excavated two curving ditches of 200 feet (60 m) at the far edge, which were constructed about 1400 CE. In addition to extensive artifacts from hundreds of years of indigenous settlement, researchers have found a variety of trade goods related to the brief interaction of Native Americans and English in the early years of Jamestown.  Around 1609, Wahunsunacock shifted his capital from Werowocomoco to Orapakes, located in a swamp at the head of the Chickahominy River, near the modern-day interchange of Interstate 64 and Interstate 295. Sometime between 1611 and 1614, he moved further north to Matchut, in present-day King William County on the north bank of the Pamunkey River, not far from where his brother Opechancanough ruled one of the member tribes at Youghtanund.\nQuestion: why?\n\nAnswer:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The Powhatan People, traditionally from Virginia, have had several major centers of their confederacy throughout history.

The Powhatan People were known to be skilled traders, and their relocations may have been driven by the need to maintain or expand their trading networks. Additionally, the shifting political landscape of the region, including the arrival of the English colonists, may have played a role in their decisions to move their capitals."}]}

The fire, which began around 10:00 PM, quickly spread across the vast expanse of the surrounding countryside, posing a significant threat to the local flora and fauna. Fire crews from across the region were immediately called upon to assist in the battle against the blazing inferno.\n\nThe Grass Fire's Origins\n\nThe exact cause of the grass fire remains unclear, but it is believed to have been sparked by a combination of factors, including lightning strikes, discarded cigarettes, and human negligence. The fire quickly spread, fueled by the dry conditions and strong winds that had been plaguing the region for weeks.\n\nThe Battle Begins\n\nAs the fire raged on, fire crews from various local and national agencies arrived on the scene to assist in the fight against the blazing inferno. The firefighters were faced with a daunting task, as the fire had already consumed a significant portion of the surrounding landscape. The fire's intensity was further exacerbated by the dense vegetation and the steep terrain, which made it difficult for the firefighters to access and control the blaze.\n\nThe Unyielding Battle\n\nThe fire crews, undeterred by the magnitude of the task before them, threw themselves into the battle with unwavering determination. They employed a variety of tactics and equipment to combat the fire, including aerial water drops, ground-based water drops, and the use of bulldozers and other heavy machinery to clear a path through the dense vegetation.\n\nDespite their best efforts, the fire continued to spread, fueled by the unforgiving conditions that had been plaguing the region. The firefighters, however, remained steadfast in their resolve, working tirelessly throughout the night to contain the blaze and protect the surrounding area.\n\nThe 11-Hour Battle\n\nThe fire raged on for a full 11 hours, with the fire crews working around the clock to keep the flames at bay. The firefighters, exhausted but determined, continued to battle the fire, knowing that the safety of the local flora and fauna, as well as the surrounding communities, depended on their success.\n\nThe Dawn of a New Day\n\nAs the first light of dawn began to break over the horizon, the fire crews finally managed to gain the upper hand in the battle against the grass fire. The fire, which had been burning for over 11 hours, was finally brought under control, and the firefighters were able to begin the long process of assessing the damage and restoring the affected area.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe battle against the rural grass fire near Loch Ness was a testament to the unwavering determination and dedication of the fire crews who fought tirelessly throughout the night. The fire, which had threatened the safety of the local flora and fauna, as well as the surrounding communities, was finally brought under control after an 11-hour battle. The firefighters, exhausted but proud of their accomplishments, were able to begin the long process of restoring the affected area, knowing that their efforts had saved countless lives and protected the natural beauty of the region."}]}

The very foods with a high carbon cost---meat, pork, dairy products, processed snacks---also tend to be filled with fat and calories. A green diet would be mostly vegetables and fruits, whole grains, fish and lean meats like chicken---a diet that's eco- and waistline-friendly. Eating green can be healthier and beneficial to the climate. It may be hard to believe that a meal at McDonald's produces more carbon than your trip to a far away place. More than 37% of the world's land is used for agriculture, much of which was once forested. Deforestation   is a major source of carbon. The fertilizer   and machinery needed on a modern farm also have a large carbon footprint, as does the network of ships and trucks that brings the food from the farm to your plate. The most efficient way to reduce the carbon footprint of your menu is to eat less meat, especially beef. Raising cattle takes a lot more energy than growing the equivalent   amount of grains, fruits or vegetables. What's more, the majority of cattle in the U.S. are fed on grain and loads of it---670 million tons in 2002---and the fertilizer used to feed that creates separate environmental problems. Focus on eating lower on the food chain, with more plants and fruits and less meat and dairy. It's simple. We can change today what goes into our bodies for the health of our planet and ourselves.

With the help of his goofball cohort Percy (Tracy Morgan), Calvin plots a jewellery shop robbery to steal one of the world's largest diamonds. After the successful robbery, the duo are almost arrested, but not before Calvin manages to stash the diamond in a nearby woman's purse. The thieves follow the handbag's owner to her home where they discover a couple, Darryl (Shawn Wayans) and Vanessa Edwards (Kerry Washington), who are eager to have a child. Calvin and Percy hatch a plot to pass Calvin off as a baby left on the couple's doorstep. Darryl and Vanessa, wanting a child, immediately adopt the baby as their own. However, Vanessa's dad Francis \"Pops\" (John Witherspoon) has a bad feeling about Calvin. Friends of the couple find Calvin odd as well. A local goon named Walken (Chazz Palminteri), discovers the deception and demands the diamond from Percy. Percy sells out Darryl and now Calvin, in a series of comedic maneuvers, manages to rescue Darryl and have Walken arrested. Darryl is given a substantial reward for the recovery of the diamond, and since Calvin saved his life, he doesn't turn him over to the police. Before he leaves, Calvin thanks Darryl for taking care of him even though he wasn't really a baby and admits that he thinks Darryl would make a great father for a real child someday. Calvin is about to be out of Darryl's life for good, as Darryl watches him leave. Calvin is crying hysterically, so Darryl decides to let Calvin stay and from that point on, the two men become the best of friends.

Article: \"All I could see was two sets of red eyes below me,\" said Dave Gatty, an Australian farmer who spent seven days up a tree in remote bush land to escape crocodiles. Gatty, 52, said he was forced to take such drastic action after he accidentally went into a crocodile-infested area of Queensland. He only had two meat sandwiches to keep him going, as crocodiles moved beneath his tree each night until his rescue. Gatty said he decided it was safer to hold out for a rescue team than try to make a run for it. His problems began after he fell off his horse while out in the northern Australia outback. Dazed and bleeding, he climbed back on his horse and hoped it would lead him home. It was only when he regained his senses he realized that he had been taken into crocodile-infested area. \"I had to get off the horse and I fell straight into a crocodile nest,\" he told reporters. \"That frightened me. I couldn't go back, it was too far and too dangerous, so I headed to the nearest high ground and stayed there, hoping someone would come and find me before the crocs did.\" Gatty explained how each night two crocodiles would sit at the bottom of the tree staring at him. Although Gatty's two sandwiches ran out after three days, he was able to get running water during the day and knew rescuers were looking for him as he could see helicopters in the air above his tree. \"If I hadn't seen the crocs circling me, and if I hadn't fallen into the croc nest, I would have made a push for it. But I knew the safest thing was for me to sit and wait,\" he said. A chocolate bar, given to him by rescuers after being moved to safety by using a winch , \"was like a gourmet (delicious)meal,\" he said. Question: The article can be classified as   _  .

Sri Guru Ram Das Institute of Dental Sciences & Research , Amritsar Guru Ram Das Ashram and Gurdwara , Millis Guru Ram Das Sarai , Harmindar Sahib Complex , Amritsar Guru Ram Das Ashram , Los Angeles , California GRD Academy , Dehra Dun , Uttarakhand ; Rajpur , Uttarakhand ; Gurgaon , Haryana ; Ludhiana , Punjab Guru Ram Das Project  - A guide is a person who leads travelers or tourists through unknown or unfamiliar locations. The term can also be applied to a person who leads others to more abstract goals such as knowledge or wisdom.  - Guru Ram Das (15341581) was the fourth of the ten Gurus of Sikhism. He was born on 24 September 1534 in a poor Hindu family based in Lahore, part of now Pakistan. His birth name was Jetha, he was orphaned at age 7, and thereafter grew up with his maternal grandmother in a village.  - Guru (. IAST: \"guru\") is a Sanskrit term that connotes someone who is a \"teacher, guide, expert, or master\" of certain knowledge or field. In pan-Indian traditions, \"guru\" is someone more than a teacher, traditionally a reverential figure to the student, with the \"guru\" serving as a \"counselor, who helps mold values, shares experiential knowledge as much as literal knowledge, an exemplar in life, an inspirational source and who helps in the spiritual evolution of a student.\" The term also refers to someone who primarily is one's spiritual guide, who helps one to discover the same potentialities that the \"guru\"s already realized.  - A teacher (also called a school teacher or, in some contexts, an educator) is a person who helps others to acquire knowledge, competences or values.  - Sanskrit (English pronunciation:; written in Devanagari script ; : or ', originally ', \"refined speech\") is the primary sacred language of Hinduism and \"Mahyna\" Buddhism, a philosophical language in Hinduism, Jainism, Buddhism and Sikhism. It was also a literary language that was in use as a \"lingua franca\" in ancient and medieval South Asia. It is a standardised dialect of Old Indo-Aryan, originating as Vedic Sanskrit and tracing its linguistic ancestry back to Proto-Indo-Iranian and Proto-Indo-European. Today it is listed as one of the 22 scheduled languages of India and is an official language of the state of Uttarakhand. As one of the oldest Indo-European languages for which substantial written documentation exists, Sanskrit holds a prominent position in Indo-European studies.  - Pakistan (or ), officially the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, is a federal parliamentary republic in South Asia on crossroads of Central Asia and Western Asia. It is the sixth-most populous country with a population exceeding 200 million people. It is the 36th largest country in the world in terms of area with an area covering . Pakistan has a coastline along the Arabian Sea and the Gulf of Oman in the south and is bordered by India to the east, Afghanistan to the west, Iran to the southwest and China in the far northeast respectively. It is separated from Tajikistan by Afghanistan's narrow Wakhan Corridor in the north, and also shares a maritime border with Oman.  - Expert is defined differently in varying academic fields. Psychology defines an expert using superior performance; sociology considers that expertise is a label given to an individual by a group and is interested in the power held by experts; philosophy stresses the kind of knowledge held by experts but not novices. Informally, an expert is someone widely recognized as a reliable source of technique or skill whose faculty for judging or deciding rightly, justly, or wisely is accorded authority and status by peers or the public in a specific well-distinguished domain. An expert, more generally, is a person with extensive knowledge or ability based on research, experience, or occupation and in a particular area of study. Experts are called in for advice on their respective subject, but they do not always agree on the particulars of a field of study. An expert can be believed, by virtue of credential, training, education, profession, publication or experience, to have special knowledge of a subject beyond that of the average person, sufficient that others may officially (and legally) rely upon the individual's opinion. Historically, an expert was referred to as a sage (Sophos). The individual was usually a profound thinker distinguished for wisdom and sound judgment.  - Hindu refers to any person who regards themselves as culturally, ethnically, or religiously adhering to aspects of Hinduism. It has historically been used as a geographical, cultural, rather than a religious identifier for people indigenous to South Asia.  - Lahore is the capital city of the Pakistani province of Punjab. It is the second largest and most populous city in Pakistan,and the 32nd most populous urban city in the world. The city is located in the north east part of Punjab province, near the border with India. Lahore is ranked as a world city, and is one of Pakistan's wealthiest cities with an estimated GDP of $58.14 billion (PPP) as of 2014.

Why to expect more weather disasters That followed a warm winter and early season droughts. News came Monday that the mainland United States experienced its warmest 12 months since the dawn of record-keeping in 1895. And on Tuesday, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) released a report calling 2011 a year of extreme weather. Wildfire victims face second tragedy Remember Hurricane Irene? Or the floods in Thailand and southern China and the deadly drought in the Horn of Africa? Heavy rains in Brazil caused massive landslides and much of Europe suffered through a sweltering heatwave.\n\nThe report pointed out that some weather events, like the"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "heatwaves and droughts, were exacerbated by the warming climate. The NOAA's Climate Extremes Index (CEI) recorded 14.3 billion weather and climate-related events in 2011, with 10.6 billion of them being heat-related. This was the highest number of heat-related events since the CEI began tracking them in 1998.\n\nThe report also highlighted the increased frequency and severity of wildfires in the United States. The year 2011 saw the second-highest number of wildfire acres burned in the country's history, with over 9.6 million acres burned. This was largely due to the prolonged drought conditions that left vegetation dry and highly flammable.\n\nThe devastating effects of these extreme weather events were evident in the loss of life, property damage, and displacement of people. In the United States, 142 people lost their lives due to weather-related disasters in 2011. The wildfires in Texas, Arizona, and California left thousands of people homeless and forced many to evacuate their homes.\n\nThe NOAA's report also pointed out the economic toll of these extreme weather events. The total cost of these events in the United States was estimated to be around $33.5 billion. This included the cost of damage to infrastructure, agriculture, and other industries.\n\nThe year 2011 marked a significant milestone in the study of climate change and its impact on the planet. The NOAA's report serves as a stark reminder of the need for continued research and action to mitigate the effects of climate change and reduce the frequency and severity of extreme weather events.\n\nAs the world continues to grapple with the consequences of climate change, it is crucial to take action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and transition to renewable energy sources. This will not only help mitigate the effects of extreme weather events but also contribute to a more sustainable future for generations to come."}]}

Context: Before we got married my husband and I lived in 4 different apartments all within the span of one year. The worst one of all of them was actually a great apartment, but our upstairs neighbors drove us positively insane. A list of their common antics: Blasting movies/music with the bass turned all the way up into the small hours of the morning, in their bedroom, which was directly above our bedroom Stomping, all day, every day, no matter what, always stomping. Sometimes running full speed around their apartment. It was a 1 bedroom and they had at least 4 adults (two couples) and at least 2 kids living there. They also always had company over. It was a nonsmoking complex but they smoked on their porch and tossed their butts over their balcony, which would leave them landing in our little porch. Constantly came out to find butts and trash in our potted plants and all over the ground. We had to call the sheriff on them once because one of the couples living there got in a very loud, very obvious domestic violence situation. We heard them screaming and throwing each other around. At one point the man smashed her head through the wall. The kicker was when they brought home one of those mini motorcycles and put it out on their porch. Their porch was made of slatted wood so there were gaps between the boards. The damn bike started leaking fuel (racing fuel no less) through the slats and on our porch (and all over our stuff). Ruined a table, some laundry I had air-drying out there and killed a few of our plants. Not only that but while this was happening they were throwing their butts down onto our porch too. Could have started a fire. Then there was the spitting. They would spit over the edge of their balcony and we complained so they started spitting THROUGH the floor boards so it was definitely intentional. I have never experienced a more trashy group of people. So glad to be out of that apartment and away from them now. Question: How does the writer feel about the stability of the family living above?

Most notably, he is considered one of the original co-founders of the National Football League (NFL) in 1920.  - August Mike Michalske ( April 24 , 1903 - October 26 , 1983 ) was an American football player and coach . He was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1964 . Originally a member of the short - lived New York Yankees National Football League team from 1927 to 1928 , Michalske arrived in Green Bay in 1929 for the first of what would be nine seasons with the team . An All - America fullback during his Penn State career , the 6 - foot , 210 pound Michalske convinced Packers coach Curly Lambeau to try him on the offensive line , where he became the first great guard in pro football , known for his combination of speed , agility and power . The first guard inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame , Michalske was a key blocker in the Packers ' championship seasons in 1929 , 1930 , and 1931 , opening holes for the likes of Johnny `` Blood '' McNally and Bob Monnett . Michalske also played on the defensive line and was dubbed `` Iron Mike '' because despite playing 60 minutes a game , he missed only 9 of 104 games during his Packers tenure , 5 of them in his final season . Moreover , throughout his football career he played with an unrepaired congenital abdominal hernia . Michalske was a six time consensus first team All - Pro in 1927 - 1931 and 1935 . He wore nine uniform numbers over his Packers career , the most by any one player in team history : 19 ( 1932 ) , 24 ( 1934 ) , 28 ( 1931 ) , 30 ( 1932 ) , 31 ( 1933 ) , 33 ( 1935 ) , 36 ( 1929 -- 30 , 37 ) , 40 ( 1935 ) and 63 ( 1934 ) . Following his Packers career , Michalske became a coach , including a head coaching stint at Iowa State from 1942 to 1946 .  - American football, referred to as football in the United States and Canada, and also known as gridiron, is a sport played by two teams of eleven players on a rectangular field with goalposts at each end. The offense, the team with control of the oval-shaped football, attempts to advance down the field by running with or passing the ball, while the team without control of the ball, the defense, aims to stop their advance and take control of the ball for themselves. The offense must advance at least ten yards in four downs, or plays, or else they turn over the football to the opposing team; if they succeed, they are given a new set of four downs. Points are primarily scored by advancing the ball into the opposing team's end zone for a touchdown or kicking the ball through the opponent's goalposts for a field goal. The team with the most points at the end of a game wins.  - Earl Louis \"Curly\" Lambeau (April 9, 1898  June 1, 1965) was a professional American football player and coach in the National Football League (NFL).

Debris from the collision poses no threat to the International Space Station. The collision on Tuesday produced two large debris clouds, NASA said. The satellites collided at 10 kilometers (6 miles) per second, producing 500-600 new pieces of space debris, the U.S. Strategic Command said. That debris is not believed to pose a threat to the International Space Station as long as the clouds continue moving in a lower orbit, according to NASA and the Russian federal space agency, Roscosmos. \"There is some elevated risk, but it is considered to be very small to the ISS and to the other satellites that NASA has in orbit,\" NASA spokeswoman Beth Dickey told CNN. She said experts were still assessing the effects of the debris. Mikhail Martirosov, from Russian mission control center, told Interfax news agency that the real threat from the debris will become obvious next week, once experts can calculate the trajectory of the fragments' descent. \"We have not received a warning of the possible danger to the ISS. The fragments may descend to the ISS orbit in several years, although I do not rule out that some fragments may go down within several days,\" Martirosov said. The Russian satellite was launched in 1993 and had been out of service at the time of the collision, Roscosmos said. The U.S. satellite was part of the Iridium global mobile communications system and is owned by a consortium headed by Motorola, the space agency said. It was launched in 1997. Iridium said in a statement Wednesday it \"expects to implement a network solution by Friday,\" and will \"move one of its in-orbit spare satellites into the network constellation to permanently replace the lost satellite\" within the next 30 days. CNN is \"one of the larger non-government users\" of Iridium, said Arnie Christianson, operations manager for CNN Satellites and Transmission. \"We do rely on it for communication in high-risk areas like Iraq, Afghanistan, and other remote locations,\" he said. \"Because of this collision, there may be a slightly longer hole in the coverage from one satellite to the next, but only in a very small area and for a very small amount of time. This is a collision, not an internal failure of the satellite or the system.\" The satellite crash may result in \"brief, occasional outages\" that may slightly disrupt service, Iridium said in the statement, adding \"this event is not the result of a failure on the part of Iridium or its technology.\" Christianson questioned how U.S. government, which tracks all space junk larger than a football, didn't see this coming. But he said the system will continue to work without any noticeable problems. A representative of Iridium could not immediately be reached for comment. NASA's Dickey said a collision like this one is very rare. \"This is the first impact between two intact satellites traveling at hypervelocity,\" she said. \"There have been some other occasions when things have accidentally collided in space, but they have been parts of rockets or parts of satellites and (produced) a very small cloud.\" Major Regina Winchester, of the U.S. Strategic Command, said: \"Space is getting pretty crowded. The fact that this hasn't happened before -- maybe we were getting a little bit lucky.\" Winchester said Strategic Command tracks more than 18,000 pieces of manmade objects in space every day. \"Any time there's an event that creates more debris, it's a concern,\" she said. \"All countries who have assets in space are going to be concerned simply because when there's more debris, there's a higher chance it's going to hit something.\" CNN's Yuri Pushkin in Moscow and Melissa Gray in London contributed to this report.\nHere is a summary of the highlights for this article:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Two satellites, one Russian and one American, have collided approximately 800 kilometers (500 miles) above Siberia, according to the Russian and U.S. space agencies.

Under-watering and over-watering can cause a variety of non-specific symptoms that sometimes overlap with other peace lily ailments. However, since improper watering is also one of the easiest problems to fix, try attempting these remedies first before moving on to a more drastic solution.  Under-watering should be fairly obvious: dry soil accompanied with wilting, yellowing leaves and a drooping stalk is a dead giveaway. Fix this by watering and misting more regularly - at least once a week for each. Note that plants that outgrow their containers will have a difficult time absorbing the water they need from a typical watering session. Over-watering can be slightly harder to diagnose, but is often characterized by brown leaf tips. Note that over-watering can lead to root rot, a separate, much more serious condition. Root rot is serious condition that can affect any potted plant with roots below the surface and can easily kill the plant. Generally, root rot is caused when a plant suffers from over-watering or poor drainage. If the roots are held in contact with standing water for a prolonged period of time, it becomes difficult for them to get the air that they need to function correctly, and as a result they will literally begin to rot. Certain types of microorganisms called water moulds contribute to the spreading rot, the spores of which can spread root rot to another plant if adequate moisture is present. Root rot is often fatal, but, to attempt to remedy it, immediately remove your lily from its pot and cut off any dead, slimy, or otherwise rotten portions of root. Pot the plant in a new pot with dry soil and proper drainage.  Though root rot infects the plant below the surface, it will cause the plant to visibly begin to die above ground. If your lily seems to become increasingly wilted even with proper sun and frequent watering, root rot is likely the culprit. Peace lilies are sometimes susceptible to infection by aphids, mites, or other small arthropods. If you notice your lily's leaves begin to wilt or die, especially if accompanied by visible pests, a sticky, slimy discharge, or the presence of white webbing, it's likely that your plant has a pest infestation. Use a strong stream of water to blast the pests off of the plant, then, to make sure they don't return, use a plant-safe insecticide or this homemade recipe for insecticidal soap: Combine 1 Tbsp. (15 ml) vegetable oil, 3 Tbsp (16 g) cayenne pepper, and 1 Tbsp. (12 g) natural fat-derived soap (not liquid dish soap) in 1 quart (.95 liters) of warm water. Use a spray bottle to give your plant a thorough coating, but not  before testing on a small part of  the plant and leaving the soap in place for a day to ensure it doesn't cause any damage. Fungus infections can range from harmless to potentially fatal. If you see a white or grey fuzzy growth on the surface of the soil, you don't need to be terribly concerned, as this fungus is not a danger to the plant (though it can irritate some humans, especially those susceptible to allergies). To clear this minor fungal growth, you may want to try sprinkling cinnamon (which has anti-fungal properties) on the  fungus. However, if the lily itself develops a dark or black coating on its stalk or leaves for no other apparent reason (frost damage, etc.), your plant likely has a serious fungal infection. Discarding the entire plant is always a viable option in this case, as fungal spores can be very persistent, remaining in the soil and surrounding area for a significant amount of time, where they can re-infect other plants. However, if you'd like to try to save the plant, carefully remove all the affected areas of the plant and discard them somewhere that they'll pose no danger. (like your garbage). Next, water the plant with compost tea, a natural fungicide, to attempt to kill spores that remain in the soil.\nWhat is a summary of what this article is about?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "This article provides information on common problems when growing peace lilies, specifically related to improper watering regimen, under-watering, over-watering, root rot, pest infestations, fungal infections, and their remedies.

Regulatory regions of a gene such as enhancers do not necessarily have to be close to the coding sequence on the linear molecule because the intervening DNA can be looped out to bring the gene and its regulatory region into proximity. Similarly, a gene's introns can be much larger than its exons. Regulatory regions can even be on entirely different chromosomes and operate in trans to allow regulatory regions on one chromosome to come in contact with target genes on another chromosome.\n\nQ: How do regulatory regions on different chromosomes operate in order to allow regions on different chromosomes to come into contact with one another?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Regulatory regions on different chromosomes operate in a process called trans-chromosomal interactions, also known as trans-chromosomal gene regulation. This process allows regulatory regions on one chromosome to come into contact with target genes on another chromosome, even though they are physically separated by large distances.\n\nTrans-chromosomal interactions occur through a process called chromatin remodeling, which involves the rearrangement of chromatin structure. Chromatin is the complex of DNA and proteins that make up chromosomes. Chromatin remodeling is essential for the regulation of gene expression, as it allows regulatory regions to interact with target genes, even if they are located on different chromosomes.\n\nThere are several mechanisms that contribute to trans-chromosomal interactions. One of the main mechanisms is the formation of chromatin loops, which bring the regulatory regions and target genes into close proximity. These loops are facilitated by the interaction of transcription factors, which are proteins that bind to specific DNA sequences and help to regulate gene expression.\n\nAnother mechanism is the formation of chromatin bridges, which are structures that physically link two chromosomes together. These bridges allow regulatory regions on one chromosome to interact with target genes on another chromosome, even though they are physically separated.\n\nTrans-chromosomal interactions are essential for the proper regulation of gene expression in many organisms, including humans. They play a critical role in the development and function of tissues and organs, as well as in the response to environmental stimuli.\n\nIn summary, regulatory regions on different chromosomes operate through trans-chromosomal interactions, which involve chromatin remodeling, chromatin loops, and chromatin bridges.

Creating such a smooth passage means adjusting a vehicle's speed so that it always arrives at the lights when they are green.That is theoretically possible, but practically hard.Roadside signs wired to traffic lights can help get the message across a couple hundred metres from a crossing, but such signs are expensive, and are not widespread.Margaret Martonosi and Emmanouil Koukoumidis at Princeton University, and Li-Shiuan Peh at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, however, have an idea that could make the process cheaper and more effective.Instead of a hardwired network of signs, they propose to use mobile-phone applications. For a driver to benefit, lie must load the team's software , named SignalGuru, into his phone and then put it on a special thing attached to the inside of his car's windscreen, with the camera lens   pointing forward.SignalGuru is designed to detect traffic lights and track their status as red, yellow or green.It broadcasts this information to other phones in the area that are fitted with the same software, and --if there are enough of them ?the phones thus each know the status of most of the lights around town.Using this information, SignalGuru is able to calculate the traffic-light schedule for the area and suggest the speed at which a driver should travel in order  to avoid red lights. Tests in Cambridge, Massachusetts, where five drivers were asked to follow the same route for three hours, and in Singapore, where eight drivers were asked to follow one of two routes for 30 minutes, revealed that SignalGuru was capable of predicting traffic-light activity with an accuracy of 98.2% and 96.3% respectively, in the two cities.This was particularly impressive because in Cambridge the lights...

A father is the person on the planet with whom we can do whatever we want ... one who will be just as interested and never feel bored in the face of our devotion. Without fathers, we wouldn't be mums. I would like to thank them from all our hearts for this honor and for being our partners in the business of raising children.

The girl has been experiencing terrifying nightmares, unexplained illnesses, and disturbing behavior, which has led her family to believe that she is possessed by a demon.\n\nFather Merrin, a seasoned exorcist, arrives at the family's home and begins the process of uncovering the demon's identity. As he delves deeper into the girl's life, he discovers that the demon's name is Pazuzu, a powerful and malevolent entity that has been haunting the family for generations.\n\nThe exorcism begins, and Father Merrin is faced with an unexpected challenge: Pazuzu is not only resistant to his attempts to banish it but also seems to be growing stronger with each passing moment. The demon's powers are vast and unpredictable, causing the family's home to shake and tremble, and even causing Father Merrin to experience visions of a dark, ancient temple.\n\nAs the exorcism progresses, Father Merrin realizes that Pazuzu is not just a simple demon but a powerful and ancient entity that has been manipulating the family for centuries. The demon's true purpose remains unclear, but it seems to be using the family as a conduit to spread its influence and power throughout the world.\n\nFather Merrin's determination to defeat Pazuzu is fueled by his belief that the demon is a threat to humanity's very existence.

I originally became interested in this project because it was being directed by Tony Scott and I have become very interested in his work after Man On Fire had such a profound impact on me. Before I start my review, let me first say this...it's wonderful to see that this movie could have been told in a boring and ordinary manner, yet the writers and Scott chose a different approach.\n\nPlot:\n\nSimply stated, it's not boring. Most Hollywood movies give 'tried and true' plots that they know will connect with people, often ensuring the audiences acceptance of the film and creating a higher probability of profit. This plot was one of the more interesting ones I had seen in a while. Just for reference, I recently watched 'The Weather Man' and 'Lord of War' and while I will say that these movies are excellent, and I enjoyed them both tremendously, both the plots in these movies are boring and they are told exactly how you would expect them to be told. They don't take any chances whatsoever, and they are extremely predictable after you've watched a fair amount of American films. Domino's plot is both interesting and told in a manner that keeps you thinking, \"oh man, they're screwed now\". And I feel that has been lacking in a lot of recent films. It has a lot of depth to it, in my opinion, and gives you plenty of things to question while watching it. Overall, this is what kept me so interested in the movie.\n\nCharacters:\n\nI felt that the characters were accurate. Knightley did a wonderful job of portraying a beautiful woman, who was anything but on the inside and wanted to be viewed as what she was. It was obvious that she wanted to prove herself and she took whatever means she had to accomplish that.\n\nChoco was also very believable, his use of Spanish in inappropriate situations, his reactions to Domino's lack of affection, as well as his jealousy issues within the team...they all rang true to me, which made me feel that his character was that much more realistic.\n\nRourke's character was the least interesting to me, but it still rang true to me. He seemed like an ordinary guy, trying to make ends meet. I hope that's what the filmmakers were trying to accomplish with him because that's what I got out of it. He did a very good job of showing Ed in an Average Joe kind of way that has made his mistakes, yet is still trying to live.\n\nClaremont/Ladies: I believe that they provided much needed 'heart' to the story. They weren't just people who are out getting money to buy a Bentley, these were real people who had a real problem and they sought others mean to accomplish that goal. You could empathize with them because, to them, this child's illness was a problem with no other solution. These characters were supposed to show real people who are less fortunate who got into this mess because they needed help.\n\nThe mobsters: They made the story seem sinister in a way that only the mob can. And I really liked that part. They also padded the story with small intricacies that made the plot that much more interesting.\n\nChristopher Walken/90210 guys:\n\nThey provided the comic relief in an otherwise very serious movie. From Walken's awkward statements to the ceaseless references to the 90210 guys being has-beens. Their involvement in the movie only made it that much more enjoyable.\n\nCinematography....yes....the cinematography. This is where this movie seems to have lost a lot of potential fans. But in my opinion I thought it was genius, the use of the camera to translate the mood of the current situation was extremely effective in my opinion. I considered it a method that was properly realized but could always use improvement, just like anything else. I both applaud and congratulate Scott, the editor, the cinematographer and the director of photography on taking some real chances with this movie. Not only did they go far and above with its presentation, they went that much further. The use of colors, both extremely light and extremely dark provided the 'look' of the film with a sinister and grungy look that accurately depicts the life of the mob, bounty hunters and the less fortunate in a manner that show that their life isn't as peachy or 'clean' as everyone else. If you notice, in times of less stress or conflict, there were very few camera tricks if any at all. This shows that Scott and his crew were trying to achieve something with this look and weren't just doing it for the heck of it. I realize that most people who watched this movie weren't expecting it and it cause many of them to be turned off to this film but I think it was great that Scott took this approach. Hollywood films have grown predictable and bland. Most of them are shot in the same manner with the same twists and turns. And I'm glad that Scott tried to make something different.\n\nGranted, this movie isn't for everyone, but to say it's trash and has nothing to offer is completely missing the point. I thoroughly enjoyed this film and I'm glad that I spent the money for it. I would recommend this to all, but I'm sure it will only hit a chord with few. I must agree with an earlier poster when he said that many of those who refuse to see outside the 'sphere of MTV' won't appreciate this movie, but I think many people will. We should all try to enjoy it for the fact that Scott and co. took some chances and tried to deliver something that was different and unique. And with that in mind, I think he succeeded tremendously.\n\nDid this review think positively or negatively of the movie (see options below)?\n\n(i) negative;\n(ii) positive;...I think the answer is"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(ii) positive;"}]}

Since 2013, the group members are Anthony Field, Lachlan Gillespie, Simon Pryce, and Emma Watkins.  The original members were Field, Phillip Wilcher, Murray Cook, Greg Page, and Jeff Fatt. Wilcher left the group after their first album. Page retired in 2006 due to ill health and was replaced by understudy Sam Moran, but returned in 2012, replacing Moran. At the end of 2012, Page, Cook, and Fatt retired, and were replaced by Gillespie, Pryce, and Watkins. Cook and Fatt retained their shareholding in the group and all three continued to have input into its creative and production aspects. Field and Fatt were members of the Australian pop band The Cockroaches in the 1980s, and Cook was a member of several bands before meeting Field and Page at Macquarie University, where they were studying to become pre-school teachers. In 1991, Field was inspired to create an album of children's music based upon concepts of early childhood education, and enlisted Cook, Page, and Fatt to assist him. They began touring to promote the album, and became so successful, they quit their teaching jobs to perform full-time.  The group augmented their act with animal characters Dorothy the Dinosaur, Henry the Octopus, and Wags the Dog, as well as the character Captain Feathersword, played by Paul Paddick since 1993.  They travelled with a small group of dancers, which later grew into a larger troupe. The group's DVDs, CDs, and television programs have been produced independently since their inception.  Their high point came in the early 2000s, after they broke into the American market. The group was formally consolidated in 2005.  They were listed at the top of Business Review Weekly's top-earning Australian entertainers four years in a row, and earned A$45 million in 2009.

The government of North Korea is a combination of a one-party socialist state and a military dictatorship, with the military playing a significant role in the country's political and economic affairs.\n\nThe North Korean government is divided into three main branches: the executive, legislative, and judicial branches. The executive branch is led by the General Secretary, who is also the head of state. The General Secretary is assisted by the Politburo, which is the highest decision-making body of the WPK. The Politburo is responsible for setting the overall direction of the country's policies and strategies.\n\nThe legislative branch of the North Korean government is the Supreme People's Assembly (SPA), which is the unicameral legislative body of the country. The SPA is composed of 666 members, who are elected by the people for a term of five years. The SPA's main function is to pass laws and approve the government's budget.\n\nThe judicial branch of the North Korean government is headed by the Supreme Court, which is the highest court in the country. The Supreme Court is responsible for interpreting the law and ensuring that the law is applied fairly and consistently.\n\nIn addition to the formal government structure, the North Korean government also has a strong military presence, with the Korean People's Army (KPA) being the country's primary military force.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Please answer the following question: Company X stopped taking on more debt, and decided to file for bankruptcy, while company Y, kept benefiting from the tax benefits of debt, having a lower debt level.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Which company had fewer costs than benefits related to debt, company X or company Y?  Hint: The trade-off theory of capital structure is the idea that a company chooses how much debt finance and how much equity finance to use by balancing the costs and benefits. The classical version of the hypothesis goes back to Kraus and Litzenberger[1] who considered a balance between the dead-weight costs of bankruptcy and the tax saving benefits of debt. Often agency costs are also included in the balance. This theory is often set up as a competitor theory to the pecking order theory of capital structure. A review of the literature is provided by Frank and Goyal.[2]  An important purpose of the theory is to explain the fact that corporations usually are financed partly with debt and partly with equity. It states that there is an advantage to financing with debt, the tax benefits of debt and there is a cost of financing with debt, the costs of financial distress including bankruptcy costs of debt and non-bankruptcy costs (e.g. staff leaving, suppliers demanding disadvantageous payment terms, bondholder/stockholder infighting, etc.). The marginal benefit of further increases in debt declines as debt increases, while the marginal cost increases, so that a firm that is optimizing its overall value will focus on this trade-off when choosing how much debt and equity to use for financing.\nAnswer:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Company Y had fewer costs than benefits related to debt, as they were able to benefit from the tax savings of debt while maintaining a lower debt level."}]}

Answer: plasma\nSolution:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The outer layer of the sun, known as the corona, is made up of plasma. Plasma is the fourth state of matter, consisting of a gas-like mixture of charged particles, such as ions and free electrons. In the case of the sun's corona, the plasma is extremely hot and dense, with temperatures reaching up to 15 million degrees Celsius and densities that are 100 times higher than Earth's atmosphere.\n\nThe high temperatures and densities in the corona cause the atoms and molecules to become ionized, meaning they lose their electrons and become positively charged ions. This ionization process creates a plasma that is electrically conductive and has unique properties, such as the ability to emit and absorb light, creating the sun's stunning visual display.\n\nThe plasma in the corona also plays a crucial role in the sun's energy generation. The intense magnetic fields and plasma interactions within the corona create a complex system of energy generation and transport, which ultimately powers the sun's radiation and wind.\n\nIn summary, the outer layer of the sun, the corona, is made up of plasma, which is a gas-like mixture of charged particles that is extremely hot and dense, and plays a vital role in the sun's energy generation and the formation of its stunning visual display."}]}

The album reached number 166 on the Billboard 200 .  - Mickey Hart (born Michael Steven Hartman, September 11, 1943) is an American percussionist and musicologist. He is best known as one of the two drummers of the rock band Grateful Dead. He was a member of the Grateful Dead from September 1967 to February 1971 and from October 1974 to August 1995. He and fellow Dead drummer Bill Kreutzmann earned the nickname \"the rhythm devils\".  - Robert Hall \"Bob\" Weir (born October 16, 1947) is an American singer, songwriter, and guitarist, most recognized as a founding member of the Grateful Dead. After the Grateful Dead disbanded in 1995, Weir performed with The Other Ones, later known as The Dead, together with other former members of the Grateful Dead. Weir also founded and played in several other bands during and after his career with the Grateful Dead, including Kingfish, the Bob Weir Band, Bobby and the Midnites, Scaring the Children, RatDog and Furthur, co-led by former Grateful Dead bassist Phil Lesh. In 2015, Weir, along with former Grateful Dead members Mickey Hart and Bill Kreutzmann, joined with Grammy-winning singer/guitarist John Mayer to form the band Dead & Company. Weir continued to tour with Dead & Company in 2016.  - Bobby and the Midnites was a rock group led by Bob Weir of the Grateful Dead. The band was Weir's main side project during the first half of the 1980s. They released two albums, but were better known for their live concerts than for their work in the recording studio. With a rhythm section that included jazz veterans Billy Cobham and, for a time, Alphonso Johnson, Bobby and the Midnites played rock music that was influenced by jazz-rock fusion.  - Space rock is a subgenre of rock music; the term originally referred to a group of early, mostly British, 1970s progressive and psychedelic rock bands such as Hawkwind, Gong, and Pink Floyd, characterised by slow, lengthy instrumental passages dominated by electronic organs, synthesizers, experimental guitar work and science fiction or outer space-related lyrical themes.  - Philip Chapman Lesh (born March 15, 1940) is a musician and a founding member of the Grateful Dead, with whom he played bass guitar throughout their 30-year career.  - The Other Ones was an American rock band formed in 1998 by former Grateful Dead members Bob Weir, Phil Lesh, and Mickey Hart, along with part-time Grateful Dead collaborator Bruce Hornsby. In 2000, Bill Kreutzmann, another Grateful Dead alumnus, joined the group, while Phil Lesh dropped out. In 2002, Lesh rejoined the band, and Hornsby left. At different times the shifting lineup of The Other Ones also included Mark Karan, Steve Kimock, John Molo, Dave Ellis, Alphonso Johnson, Jimmy Herring, Rob Barraco, Jeff Chimenti, and Susan Tedeschi. In 2003, The Other Ones changed their name to The Dead.  - Deadhead or Dead Head is a name given to fans of the American psychedelic rock band the Grateful Dead. In the 1970s, a number of fans began travelling to see the band in as many shows or festival venues as they could. With large numbers of people thus attending strings of shows, a community developed. Deadheads developed their own idioms and slang.  - Reggae is a music genre that originated in Jamaica in the late 1960s. The term also denotes the modern popular music of Jamaica and its diaspora. A 1968 single by Toots and the Maytals \"Do the Reggay\" was the first popular song to use the word \"reggae,\" effectively naming the genre and introducing it to a global audience. While sometimes used in a broad sense to refer to most types of popular Jamaican dance music, the term \"reggae\" more properly denotes a particular music style that was strongly influenced by traditional mento as well as American jazz and rhythm and blues, especially the New Orleans R&B practiced by Fats Domino and Allen Toussaint, and evolved out of the earlier genres ska and rocksteady. Reggae usually relates news, social gossip, and political comment. Reggae spread into a commercialized jazz field, being known first as Rudie Blues, then Ska, later Blue Beat, and Rock Steady. It is instantly recognizable from the counterpoint between the bass and drum downbeat, and the offbeat rhythm section. The immediate origins of reggae were in ska and rock steady; from the latter, reggae took over the use of the bass as a percussion instrument.  - John Clayton Mayer (born October 16, 1977) is an American singer-songwriter, guitarist, and producer. He was born in Bridgeport, Connecticut, and raised in nearby Fairfield. He attended Berklee College of Music in Boston, but disenrolled and moved to Atlanta in 1997 with Clay Cook. Together, they formed a short-lived two-man band called Lo-Fi Masters. After their split, Mayer continued to play local clubsrefining his skills and gaining a following. After his appearance at the 2001 South by Southwest Festival, he was signed to Aware Records, and then Columbia Records, which released his first EP, \"Inside Wants Out\". His following two full-length albums\"Room for Squares\" (2001) and \"Heavier Things\" (2003)did well commercially, achieving multi-platinum status. In 2003, he won the Grammy Award for Best Male Pop Vocal Performance for the single \"Your Body Is a Wonderland\".  - The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum is a hall of fame and museum located on the shore of Lake Erie in downtown Cleveland, Ohio, United States. The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Foundation was established on April 20, 1983, by Atlantic Records founder and chairman Ahmet Ertegun to recognize and archive the history of the best-known and most influential artists, producers, engineers, and other notable figures who have had some major influence on the development of rock and roll. In 1986, Cleveland was chosen as the hall of fame's permanent home. Since opening in September 1995, the \"Rock Hall\"  part of the city's redeveloped North Coast Harbor  has hosted more than 10 million visitors and had a cumulative economic impact estimated at more than $1.8 billion.  - William \"Bill\" Kreutzmann, Jr. (born May 7, 1946) is an American drummer. He played with the Grateful Dead for its entire thirty-year career, usually alongside fellow drummer Mickey Hart, and has continued to perform with former members of the Grateful Dead in various lineups, and with his own bands BK3, 7 Walkers and Billy & the Kids.  - The Grateful Dead was an American rock band formed in 1965 in Palo Alto, California. Ranging from quintet to septet, the band is known for its unique and eclectic style, which fused elements of country, folk, bluegrass, blues, reggae, rock, improvisational jazz, psychedelia, and space rock, for live performances of lengthy instrumental jams, and for their devoted fan base, known as \"Deadheads\". \"Their music,\" writes Lenny Kaye, \"touches on ground that most other groups don't even know exists.\" These various influences were distilled into a diverse and psychedelic whole that made the Grateful Dead \"the pioneering Godfathers of the jam band world\". The band was ranked 57th by \"Rolling Stone\" magazine in its \"The Greatest Artists of all Time\" issue. The band was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1994 and their Barton Hall Concert at Cornell University (May 8, 1977) was added to the National Recording Registry of the Library of Congress. The Grateful Dead have sold more than 35 million albums worldwide.  - RatDog (sometimes known as The Ratdog Revue, Bob Weir & RatDog or Ratdog) is an American rock band. The group began as a side project for Grateful Dead rhythm guitarist Bob Weir and bassist Rob Wasserman. After the Grateful Dead disbanded in December 1995 following the death of Jerry Garcia on August 9 of that year, RatDog became Bob Weir's primary band. The band performed until July, 2014. They performed Grateful Dead tunes primarily with a mixture of covers (including Bob Dylan and Chuck Berry songs), along with some originals. RatDog's repertoire consisted of more than 150 songs.

In the chaotic situation, local Irish lords won back large amounts of land. The invasion by Edward Bruce in 1315-18 at a time of famine weakened the Norman economy. The Black Death arrived in Ireland in 1348. Because most of the English and Norman inhabitants of Ireland lived in towns and villages, the plague hit them far harder than it did the native Irish, who lived in more dispersed rural settlements. After it had passed, Gaelic Irish language and customs came to dominate the country again. The English-controlled area shrank back to the Pale, a fortified area around Dublin. Outside the Pale, the Hiberno-Norman lords intermarried with Gaelic noble families, adopted the Irish language and customs and sided with the Gaelic Irish in political and military conflicts against the Lordship. They became known as the Old English, and in the words of a contemporary English commentator, were \"more Irish than the Irish themselves.\" The authorities in the Pale worried about the Gaelicisation of Norman Ireland, and passed the Statutes of Kilkenny in 1366 banning those of English descent from speaking the Irish language, wearing Irish clothes or inter-marrying with the Irish. The government in Dublin had little real authority. By the end of the 15th century, central English authority in Ireland had all but disappeared.

Whether he was escaping from a locked box or making things disappear and reappear, he surely was entertaining. People thought that he must truly have some supernatural powers, but in fact, what Harry really had was drive.  Harry was born in Budapest, Hungary, in 1874. His real name was Ehrich Weiss, the third of five children. His family moved to Wisconsin not long after his birth and when he was nine, he was tying ropes all over his backyard and learning amazing tricks to show his friends and neighbors. He visited the local locksmith, and when he had reached his teens he could pick almost any lock that was made. He also learned how to do card tricks. He and his brother, Theo, would often entertain at local parties and clubs for extra money.  When Ehrich was 16, he came across a book that would actually change his life: the biography of France's greatest magician, Jean Eugene Robert-Houdin. It showed Ehrich that his hobby of magic and tricks could also be a career. Immediately, he changed his name to Harry Houdini. He and Theo headed out to make a living as magicians. In 1893, they performed at the Chicago World's Fair, and after that they traveled around giving magic shows for anyone willing to listen and pay. Theo grew restless, however, as the jobs became scarce, so he left. His timing was perfect since Harry had just fallen in love with a lovely woman named Bess who was just the right size for slipping in and out of the trunk they used in their magic tricks. They married immediately and then off they went, traveling with circuses and other road shows. Harry learned more and more tricks and spent much of his time reading and studying all kinds of locks, especially handcuffs. However, no matter what tricks they did or how hard they tried, Bess and Harry were not doing well. They tried to sell their shows for seven years and finally, in desperation, they went to Europe.           It was the right move. Harry's persistence and...

He was a key figure in the introduction of the Indian philosophies of Vedanta and Yoga to the Western world and is credited with raising interfaith awareness, bringing Hinduism to the status of a major world religion during the late 19th century. He was a major force in the revival of Hinduism in India, and contributed to the concept of nationalism in colonial India. Vivekananda founded the Ramakrishna Math and the Ramakrishna Mission.\n\nVivekananda propagated that the essence of Hinduism was best expressed in Adi Shankara's Advaita Vedanta philosophy. Nevertheless, following Ramakrishna, and in contrast to Advaita Vedanta, Vivekananda believed that the Absolute is both immanent and transcendent. According to Anil Sooklal, Vivekananda's neo-Advaita \"reconciles Dvaita or dualism and Advaita or non-dualism\". Vivekananda summarised the Vedanta as follows, giving it a modern and Universalistic interpretation:  Each soul is potentially divine. The goal is to manifest this Divinity within by controlling nature, external and internal. Do this either by work, or worship, or mental discipline, or philosophy--by one, or more, or all of these--and be free. This is the whole of religion. Doctrines, or dogmas, or rituals, or books, or temples, or forms, are but secondary details.  Nationalism was a prominent theme in Vivekananda's thought. He believed that a country's future depends on its people, and his teachings focused on human development. He wanted \"to set in motion a machinery which will bring noblest ideas to the doorstep of even the poorest and the meanest\".  Vivekananda linked morality with control of the mind, seeing truth, purity and unselfishness as traits which strengthened it. He advised his followers to be holy, unselfish and to have shraddha (faith). Vivekananda supported brahmacharya (celibacy), believing it the source of his physical and mental stamina and eloquence. He emphasised that success was an outcome of focused thought and action; in his lectures on Raja Yoga he said, \"Take up one idea. Make that one idea your life - think of it, dream of it, live on that idea. Let the brain, muscles, nerves, every part of your body, be full of that idea, and just leave every other idea alone. This is the way to success, that is the way great spiritual giants are produced\".\n\nUsing a quote from the above article, answer the following question: Who were his followers?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Vivekananda's followers were primarily individuals who were drawn to his teachings on Advaita Vedanta, Yoga, and the revival of Hinduism in India.

His followers were also influenced by his ideas on nationalism and the importance of human development. The Ramakrishna Math and the Ramakrishna Mission, which Vivekananda founded, were instrumental in spreading his teachings and attracting followers."}]}

Avco gave Bell complete creative control over the Stylistics and he proceeded to focus the group's sound exclusively around Thompkins's voice. On most of the group hits, Bell would have Thompkins sing virtually solo.  The first song recorded with Bell and his collaborator, lyricist Linda Creed, was the lush \"Stop, Look, Listen\". Bell imported techniques he had perfected with The Delfonics and his musical arrangements worked perfectly with Thompkins' falsetto vocals.  Their hits from this period --distilled from three albums-- included \"Betcha by Golly, Wow\" (U.S. #3), \"I'm Stone in Love with You\", \"Break Up to Make Up\" (U.S. #5), \"You Make Me Feel Brand New\" featuring Thompkins singing a rare lead vocal duet with Airrion Love, the aforementioned \"Stop, Look, Listen\", \"You Are Everything\", and the Top 20 Pop hit \"Rockin' Roll Baby\" (U.S. #14). \"You Make Me Feel Brand New\" was the group's biggest U.S. hit, holding at No. 2 for two weeks just as the spring of 1974 turned to summer, and was one of the group's five U.S. gold singles.  The Stylistics' smooth sound also found an easier path on to adult contemporary airwaves than many other soul artists and the group made Billboard magazine's Easy Listening singles chart twelve times from 1971 to 1976, with three entries (\"Betcha by Golly, Wow\", \"You Make Me Feel Brand New\", and \"You'll Never Get to Heaven (If You Break My Heart)\") reaching the Top 10. Every single that Bell produced for the Stylistics was a Top Ten R&B hit, and several--\"You Are Everything\", \"Betcha by Golly Wow!\", \"I'm Stone in Love with You\", \"Break Up to Make Up\", and \"You Make Me Feel Brand New\"--were also Top Ten pop chart hits. The group also enjoyed commercial success with big hits with this material throughout Europe.\n\nEntity:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The entity this text is about is the Philadelphia soul group called The Stylistics.

Moreover, he has become estranged from both love interest Mary Jane, who to Peter's disappointment is in a relationship, and best friend Harry Osborn who falsely accuses Spider-Man of murdering his father, and Aunt May is threatened with foreclosure.Harry, now head of Oscorp's research division, has invested in the research of brilliant scientist Otto Octavius, Peter's idol. To perform a sustained fusion experiment, Octavius has developed a set of artificially intelligent mechanical arms, which are impervious to heat and magnetism. Though the experiment overloads and becomes unstable, Dr. Octavius refuses to halt it, with devastating results: his wife is killed; the neural inhibitor chip which prevented the advanced AI of the arms from influencing Octavius's own mind is destroyed; and the arms are fused to his spine. Unconscious, he is taken to a hospital to have the appendages removed, but the tentacles develop their own ability to move at will and brutally kill the surgeons, and Octavius escapes. Uncontrolled, the tentacles begin to corrupt Octavius' mind, playing on his vanity and ego, and he decides he must complete his experiment at any cost. J. Jonah Jameson names him \"Doctor Octopus\" or \"Doc Ock\". In an effort to finance his experiments, Doc Ock attempts to rob a bank where Peter Parker and his Aunt May happen to be present.

Taylor formed Stone Sour in 1992, playing in the Des Moines area, and working on a demo. He joined Slipknot in 1997 to replace their original vocalist and has subsequently released five studio albums with them. After the first two Slipknot albums went Platinum, Taylor revived Stone Sour to record an album and tour in 2002.\n\nCorey Todd Taylor was born on December 8, 1973 in Des Moines, Iowa. He was mostly raised by his single mother in Waterloo, Iowa, a place described by Taylor as a \"hole in the ground with buildings around it\". He is of Irish, German and Native American descent on his father's side, and Dutch and Irish on his mother's side. In 1979, Taylor and his mother saw the sci-fi series Buck Rogers in the 25th Century. Before the series, there was a trailer for the 1978 horror film Halloween. Taylor said this \"developed some sense of Slipknot in [himself]\". While Halloween introduced Taylor to masks and horror themes, Taylor's grandmother introduced him to rock music, showing him a collection of Elvis Presley records from the 1950s to 1970s. He especially found songs like \"Teddy Bear\", \"In the Ghetto\", and \"Suspicious Minds\" to appeal to his interests the most, describing them as \"good times\". Taylor also began listening to Black Sabbath at a young age, beginning with their early work.  Taylor, along with his mother and sister, lived at one point in an \"old dilapidated farmhouse\" which on days in late autumn would \"look like Black Sabbath album covers\". By age 15, he had developed a drug addiction and had overdosed on cocaine twice. By this time, he was living in Waterloo, but later set out on his own and ended up at his grandmother's house in Des Moines. She took legal custody of him so that he could continue going to school, and she helped him buy musical equipment. When Taylor was 18, he left his grandmother's house and went to various places in Iowa, Des Moines being a place to which he frequently returned.  In 2017, on an episode of Viceland's The Therapist, Taylor revealed that he was sexually assaulted at the age of 10 by a 16-year-old friend. Taylor stated that he never told anyone about the incident until he was \"probably 18\" because his abuser \"threatened to hurt [him] and threatened to hurt [his] mom\". At age 18, when Taylor was living with his grandmother, he attempted suicide by way of overdose. His ex-girlfriend's mother drove him to the hospital in Des Moines and doctors were able to resuscitate him. He describes this as the lowest point in his life. Taylor first met his father when he was 30 years old, and now has a relationship with him, although he said their paths do not cross that often.\n\nWho took legal custody of him"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Corey Todd Taylor's grandmother took legal custody of him."}]}

She felt alone and hopeless. Then she went into the kitchen and grabbed what she needed before going back up to her room quietly. She switched on the TV and started eating...and eating...for hours, until it was all gone. What Emily didn't know at the time was that she was suffering from an illness called binge-eating disorder(BED) . For years, Emily didn't tell anyone what she was doing. She felt ashamed, alone, and out of control. Why don't famous people confess   to BED, as they do to _ ? It's simple: There's a stigma involved. \"Overeating is seen as very bad, but dieting to be skinny is seen as positive and even associated with determination,\" says Charles Sophy, a doctor in Beverly Hills , California. \"Some parents or friends may look at a teen with BED and think, 'Oh, a good diet and some will-power will do the trick.' But that's not true,\" says Dr.Ovidio Bermudez , a baby doctor at the Eating Recovery Center in Denver. \"Eating disorders are real physical and mental health issues; it's not about willpower.\" The focus in treating BED shouldn't be on weight, because as with all eating disorders, the behaviors with food are a symptom of something deeper. Like most other diseases, genetics may play a big part in who gets BED and who doesn't. If you have a close relative with an eating disorder, that means you're more likely to develop an eating disorder of your own. Besides, many people with BED have tried at some point or another to control it by going on a diet, but paying more attention to food doesn't help. And it might even make things worse, like it did for Carla, who's 15 now and is recovering from BED. \"My parents would always tease me about my weight, so when I was 14, I went on a very restrictive diet,\" she says. When you can't have something, you only want it more, so every time Carla would have a bite of something that wasn't allowed on her strict diet. She would quickly lose control and binge  .

A centrifuge is a device that uses centrifugal force to separate particles or substances from a mixture. It is commonly used in various fields, including biology, chemistry, and physics.\n\nIn the context of separating two liquids, a centrifuge works by placing the mixture inside a cylindrical container, called a centrifuge tube or a centrifuge tube. The centrifuge then spins the container at a high speed, typically between 1000 and 10,000 rpm (revolutions per minute). This high-speed rotation causes the centrifugal force to separate the two liquids based on their densities.\n\nThe denser liquid will be forced towards the bottom of the centrifuge tube, while the less dense liquid will be pushed towards the top. As the centrifuge continues to spin, the two liquids will eventually separate completely, with the denser liquid at the bottom and the less dense liquid at the top.\n\nCentrifuges come in various sizes and designs, depending on the specific application and the type of mixture being separated. Some common types of centrifuges include:\n\n1. Clinical centrifuges: These centrifuges are designed for use in clinical settings, such as in hospitals and diagnostic laboratories. They are typically used for blood separation, plasma separation, and other applications.\n\n2. Research centrifuges: These centrifuges are designed for use in research settings, such as in biology and chemistry laboratories. They are typically used for separating various types of particles, such as cells, proteins, and nucleic acids.\n\n3. Ultracentrifuges: These centrifuges are designed for use in high-speed centrifugation applications, such as density gradient separation and isopycnic separation. They can reach speeds of up to 100,000 rpm.\n\n4. Microcentrifuges: These centrifuges are designed for use with small volumes of liquid, such as in molecular biology and biochemistry applications. They are typically used for centrifuging small samples, such as cell lysates or protein suspensions.\n\nIn summary, a centrifuge is an instrument that can separate two liquids by spinning them at high speed. The centrifuge works by using centrifugal force to separate the two liquids based on their densities, and it is commonly used in various fields, including biology, chemistry, and physics."}]}

The renal artery is a major blood vessel that connects the aorta, the largest artery in the body, to the kidney. This artery carries oxygenated blood from the heart to the kidney, where it is used for various functions such as filtering waste products, regulating blood pressure, and maintaining electrolyte balance.\n\nThe renal artery is a vital component of the renal circulation system, which is responsible for supplying blood to the kidneys. The kidneys are responsible for maintaining homeostasis in the body by regulating the levels of various substances in the blood, such as water, electrolytes, and waste products. The renal artery plays a crucial role in this process by delivering oxygenated blood to the kidneys, which then use this blood to perform their functions.\n\nThe renal artery is a branch of the aorta, which is the largest artery in the body. The aorta is responsible for carrying oxygenated blood from the heart to the rest of the body. The renal artery is one of the major branches of the aorta, and it is responsible for supplying blood to the kidneys.\n\nThe renal artery connects to capillaries inside the kidney. These capillaries are called glomeruli, and they are the primary site of filtration in the kidneys. The glomeruli are surrounded by a network of capillaries called the proximal tubules, which are responsible for reabsorbing water and electrolytes from the filtrate. The filtrate that is not reabsorbed by the proximal tubules is then passed on to the distal tubules, where it is further processed and eventually excreted in the urine.\n\nThe capillaries and nephrons in the kidney lie very close to each other. Nephrons are the basic functional units of the kidney, and they are responsible for performing the various functions of the kidneys, such as filtration, reabsorption, and excretion of substances in the blood. The capillaries and nephrons work together to maintain homeostasis in the body by regulating the levels of various substances in the blood.\n\nIn summary, blood flows into the kidney through the renal artery, which is a major blood vessel that connects the aorta to the kidney.

After class I offered to help Maria deal with her financial problems. She hesitated to accept my offer, and I could see from the expression on her face that she was afraid of what it might involve. I quickly promised her that I wouldn't make her do more than she was able to. I told her frankly that I didn't enjoy managing my money any more than she did hers and wouldn't burden her with guilt, judgments, or impossible tasks.  All I would ask her to do was to let me help her look at her fears and try to make some sense of them. Maria still resisted my offer, and I can remember the excuses she gave me as they were the repeated complaints I had heard from so many people. \"I'11 never understand money,\" she said. \"My facts are meaningless.\" \"I don't deserve to have money.\" \"I never have enough,\" \"I have too little to manage.\" \"My financial position isn't worth looking at.\" and the most  _ one of all, \"I just can't do it.\" Going home that day, I couldn't get Maria out of my mind: Her attitude conveyed the same negativity and fear that I believed annoyed many people. I was sure it was this attitude that prevented people from managing their money effectively. My counseling   has taught me that these anxieties are inseparably connected to our self-doubts and fear for survival. Many of us are terrified of handling our money because we don't believe we can do it well, and to do it wrong would put our very existence at risk.  On a deeper level we know that money is not the source of life, but sense of worth drives us to act as if it were. It locks us up in self-doubts and prevents us from tapping into the true source of our management power, our spirit. Maria's words moved the author and others because they were_.

(December 2014) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) On the Valentine's Day of 1997, in a small town, a cave-in on the north side of a Hanninger mine trapped six miners. Six days later, rescue teams found five dead miners and the comatose Harry Warden (Richard John Walters), who survived by killing the other miners with a pickaxe, allowing himself to breathe. Tom Hanniger (Jensen Ackles) the owner's son, was blamed for the mine disaster because he forgot to vent the methane lines and caused a cave-in, but also Harry Warden for killing the miners. A year later, Valentine's Day, Warden wakes from his coma in the hospital, and goes on a murderous rampage. Soon after, Sheriff Burke (Tom Atkins) arrives, finding multiple mutilated bodies many of which have been severed in half and the heart of a nurse inside a candy box. Burke and his partner come to the conclusion that Warden had awoken from his coma and, realizing they don't have much time left, they try to figure out where he's headed. Meanwhile, at the abandoned mine shaft that was the site of the disaster, a party is in full swing, attended by many teens, including Axel Palmer (Kerr Smith), his girlfriend, Irene (Betsy Rue), Tom Hanniger and his girlfriend, Sarah (Jaime King). Tom was initially reluctant to go, but he goes anyway. He leaves Sarah and goes back to his car to pick up some beers before going inside. Sarah goes alone and gets lost looking for Axel and Irene. She runs across a teen and a few seconds later, he is stabbed through his eye. She is confronted by Warden in full miner's garb, carrying a bloody pickaxe, and she flees, finding several dead bodies. Axel grabs her and they, along with Irene, hide from the killer. Warden eventually sees the trio, and they run out of the mine, meeting Tom as he comes in.

The singles \"How To Be A Millionaire\" and \"Be Near Me\" are worth the price of purchase for this CD. In my opinion, \"How To Be A Millionaire\" is a very underrated pop single from the early 80's and I don't understand why you don't hear it with all of the 80's retro going on now. You often hear \"Be Near Me\" in the 80's retro radio programming now. And then there is \"So Hip It Hurts\", a very campy but still very funky dance track that still makes me want to dance.ABC had a unique sound with the vocals of Martin Fry and Eden. And I think their work on this particular album has stood the test of time pretty well.

He was named after his stepfather, Calvin Cordozar Broadus Sr. His mother is Beverly Broadus (nee Tate). His father, Vernell Varnado, was a Vietnam veteran, singer, and mail carrier who was said to be frequently absent from his life.\nContext: Snoop signed with Master P's No Limit Records (distributed by Priority/EMI Records) in 1998 and debuted on the label with Da Game Is to Be Sold, Not to Be Told that year. His other albums from No Limit were No Limit Top Dogg in 1999 (selling over 1,503,865 copies) and Tha Last Meal in 2000 (selling over 2,000,000). In 1999, his autobiography, Tha Doggfather, was published.  In 2002, he released the album Paid tha Cost to Be da Bo$$, on Priority/Capitol/EMI, with it selling over 1,300,000 copies. The album featured the hit singles \"From tha Chuuuch to da Palace\" and \"Beautiful\", featuring guest vocals by Pharrell. By this stage in his career, Snoop Dogg had left behind his \"gangster\" image and embraced a \"pimp\" image.  In 2004, Snoop signed to Geffen Records/Star Trak Entertainment both of which were distributed through Interscope Records; Star Trak is headed by producer duo the Neptunes, which produced several tracks for Snoop's 2004 release R&G (Rhythm & Gangsta): The Masterpiece. \"Drop It Like It's Hot\" (featuring Pharrell), the first single released from the album, was a hit and became Snoop Dogg's first single to reach number one. His third release was \"Signs\", featuring Justin Timberlake and Charlie Wilson, which entered the UK chart at No. 2. This was his highest entry ever in the UK chart. The album sold 1,724,000 copies in the U.S. alone, and most of its singles were heavily played on radio and television. Snoop Dogg joined Warren G and Nate Dogg to form the group 213 and released album The Hard Way in 2004. Debuting at No.4 on the Billboard 200 and No.1 on the Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums, it included single \"Groupie Luv\". Snoop Dogg appeared in the music video for Korn's \"Twisted Transistor\", along with fellow rappers Lil Jon, Xzibit, and David Banner,  Snoop Dogg's appeared on two tracks from Ice Cube's 2006 album Laugh Now, Cry Later, including the single \"Go to Church\", and on several tracks on Tha Dogg Pound's Cali Iz Active the same year.

Black bears are the smallest of all American bears, ranging in length from five to six feet, weighing from three hundred to five hundred pounds.

Like all bears, the black bear is timid and rarely dangerous, but if attacked, most can climb trees or cover ground at great speed. When angry or frightened, they are formidable  _ . Black bears feed on leaves, roots, fruit, insects, fish, and even larger animals. One of the most interesting characteristics of bears, including the black bear, is their winter sleep. Unlike squirrels and many other woodland animals, bears do not actually sleep through the winter months. Although the bear does not eat during the winter months, sustaining  itself from body fat, its temperature remains almost normal, and it breathes regularly four or five times per minute. Most black bears live alone, except during the mating  season. They prefer to live in caves. Baby black bears are born in January or February after a gestation  period of six to nine months, and they stay with their mother until they are fully grown or about one and a half years old.

Hector Villa is a young Mexican national and border-crossing migrant and worker with boxing abilities mirroring his late father's. He could perhaps be good if he learned to think along with his pummeling. Despite all of this, Hector is a hard worker on a Texas farm who does what he can to provide for his ailing mother which includes pulling in a few side dollars from small-time, illegal gambling fights. Tito, a \"coyote\" (a person who helps smuggle people across the border) spends his days as a snake catcher but at night, helps smuggle immigrants across the border. After winning a fight in a local mechanic's garage, Hector tries to get another fight but the entertainment is interrupted by Tito who scolds both Hector and the owner due to the fact that Tito could  get into more trouble for illegal gambling fights as if smuggling illegals across the border isn't enough. Corralled, Hector goes to change but is followed in by another illegal; Maria. It soon becomes known that they grew up together as kids and it also becomes apparent that Hector dislikes her (mostly because of her sarcastic teasing). Tito hands Hector medicine for his mother and the three head back to the farm where they all work. After settling all of the immigrants in, Maria goes into her own suite with Hector and makes herself at home despite Hector being less than welcoming. Hector then goes to his mother Rosa to give her the medicine but it becomes apparent that she is getting worse. Hector begs her to not go out to the fields the next day but she declines stating \"No work, no pay\". She scolds Hector for fighting to make money and reminds him that a fighter's lifestyle gave his father nothing. Maria walks in and gets reacquainted with Hector's mother who comments on how much she has grown  and how beautiful she has gotten after nine years apart.\nAnswer:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The first name of the character whose next fight is interrupted by a coyote is Hector."}]}

Article: An 18-year-old girl Anna Meier from Austria is taking her parents to court for posting over 500 photos of her on Facebook since 2009,without her permission. Anna has apparently become fed up with her parents' refusal to take down the embarrassing photos of her at an early age,and is now seeking justice in court.She told the magazine that even though she was 11 years old when her parents started sharing her photos with several hundreds of Facebook friends,they went as far as to post pictures of her as a baby,without ever asking if it was alright with her.\"They knew no shame and no limit--and didn't care whether it was a picture of me sitting on the toilet or lying naked in my bed--every stage was photographed and then made public,\"the girl said. The girl added that she was only able to see the photos posted on Facebook by her parents  when she was 14,after setting up her own account on it.Again and again,Anna asked her parents to remove the photos of her immediately,but they refused.Angry and upset,she felt that she had no other way but to take them to court,which she did as soon as she turned 18 this year.\"I'm tired of not being taken seriously by my parents,\"she said. Anna's lawyer claims they have a good chance of winning the case in court,if it can be  proven that the images have violated  her rights to a personal life.But,based on similar cases and according to Austrian privacy laws,if the parents lose,they may be forced to pay their daughter a fine of EUR 3,000 to EUR10,000. But Anna's parents,however,see nothing wrong with posting baby photos of her.\"I consider it my right to publish these photos,\"her father said. \"We have posted no more photos of our daughter since she stopped allowing us to photograph her.We also have baby photos of her that can only be seen by a limited group of 700 Facebook friends.\" It's reported that Anna has moved out of her parents' home and is living with some girls in a rented apartment.

Created in 1997, Laika is positioned behind the cosmonauts with her ears erect. The Monument to the Conquerors of Space, constructed in 1964, also includes Laika. On 11 April 2008  at the military research facility where staff had been responsible for readying Laika for the flight, officials unveiled a monument of her poised on top of a space rocket. Stamps and envelopes picturing Laika were produced, as well as branded cigarettes and matches.Future space missions carrying dogs would be designed to be recovered. Four other dogs died in Soviet space missions: Bars and Lisichka were killed when their R-7 rocket exploded shortly after launch on 28 July 1960; Pchyolka and Mushka died when Korabl-Sputnik 3 was purposely destroyed with an explosive charge to prevent foreign powers from inspecting the capsule after a wayward atmospheric reentry trajectory on 1 December 1960.Although never shown, Laika is prominently mentioned in the 1985 film My Life as a Dog, in which the main character (a young Swedish boy in the late 1950s) identifies strongly with the dog. Laika, a 2007 graphic novel by Nick Abadzis giving a fictionalized account of Laika's life, won the Eisner Award for Best Publication for Teens. Laika is also mentioned in the 2004 song \"Neighborhood #2 (Laika)\" by Arcade Fire, included on their debut album Funeral.

The baking soda will dissolve better in warm water. Once you have your warm water solution, you can follow these steps to create beautiful and fascinating baking soda crystals:\n\n1. Prepare your materials: You will need a clean, clear glass or plastic container, a spoon or a small stick, and a piece of paper or a small object to place on the surface of the baking soda crystals.\n\n2. Add the baking soda to the water: Slowly pour the warm water into the container, then add the baking soda. Stir the mixture gently to ensure that the baking soda is evenly distributed in the water.\n\n3. Observe the reaction: As the baking soda dissolves in the water, you will notice a fizzing or bubbling effect. This is due to the chemical reaction between the baking soda and the water.\n\n4. Create the crystals: Once the reaction has subsided, you can begin to create the crystals. Using the spoon or small stick, gently stir the mixture to create small, round crystals. The size of the crystals will depend on the size of the container and the amount of baking soda used.\n\n5. Add a base: To help the crystals grow and form a more stable structure, you can add a base to the mixture. Common bases include vinegar, lemon juice, or a solution of baking soda and water. Add a few drops of the base to the mixture and watch as the crystals begin to grow and expand.\n\n6. Observe the crystals: As the crystals grow, they will become more visible and form a beautiful, sparkling display. You can observe the crystals for several hours or even days, as they will continue to grow and change over time.\n\n7. Preserve the crystals: To preserve the crystals, you can carefully remove them from the container using a spoon or a small stick. Gently rinse the crystals with water to remove any residue, then pat them dry with a clean cloth. You can then display the crystals in a glass jar or on a piece of paper to showcase their beauty.\n\nIn conclusion, making baking soda crystals is a fascinating and educational activity that can be enjoyed by people of all ages. By following these simple steps, you can create stunning and captivating crystals that will delight and inspire you."}]}

The dielectric is used in very thin layers and so absolute breakdown voltage of capacitors is limited. Typical ratings for capacitors used for general electronics applications range from a few volts to 1 kV. As the voltage increases, the dielectric must be thicker, making high-voltage capacitors larger per capacitance than those rated for lower voltages. The breakdown voltage is critically affected by factors such as the geometry of the capacitor conductive parts; sharp edges or points increase the electric field strength at that point and can lead to a local breakdown. Once this starts to happen, the breakdown quickly tracks through the dielectric until it reaches the opposite plate, leaving carbon behind and causing a short (or relatively low resistance) circuit. The results can be explosive as the short in the capacitor draws current from the surrounding circuitry and dissipates the energy.\n\nAnswer this question, if possible (if impossible, reply \"unanswerable\"): Of what order is the breakdown field strength for mica dielectric capacitors?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The breakdown field strength for mica dielectric capacitors is of the order 100 to 300 MV/m."}]}

Amphibians are a diverse group of vertebrates that are characterized by their ability to live in both water and on land. They are found in various habitats, including forests, grasslands, wetlands, and even the ocean.\n\nAmphibians undergo a unique life cycle that involves metamorphosis, which is the process of transforming from an aquatic larval stage to a terrestrial adult form. This process is essential for their survival, as it allows them to adapt to different environments and avoid predators.\n\nThe life cycle of amphibians consists of four main stages: egg, larva, tadpole, and adult. The first stage is the egg, which is laid in water. The eggs are soft and have no protective covering, making them vulnerable to predators and environmental factors.\n\nAfter a few weeks, the eggs hatch into larvae, which are also known as tadpoles. Tadpoles are entirely aquatic and have gills for breathing. They feed on algae and other small organisms, and their bodies are segmented and have a dorsal fin.\n\nAs the tadpoles grow, they undergo metamorphosis, during which they develop lungs and lose their tails. The tadpoles then transform into adult amphibians, which are capable of breathing through their lungs and skin. Adult amphibians are adapted to life on land, with legs and feet for walking and jumping, and a moist skin that helps them absorb water and oxygen.\n\nAmphibians are an essential part of many ecosystems, serving as both predators and prey. They play a vital role in controlling insect populations and help maintain the balance of aquatic environments. However, amphibians are also threatened by habitat loss, pollution, and disease, which can lead to population declines and even extinction.\n\nIn conclusion, amphibians are the animals that live part of their lives in water and part on land, and go through metamorphosis. They are a diverse group of vertebrates that play a crucial role in maintaining the balance of ecosystems. Understanding their life cycle and the threats they face is essential for their conservation and the preservation of biodiversity."}]}

Gwaltney, Jr. a professor at the University Of Virginia School Of Medicine infected six student volunteers with virus, the most common cause of colds. A few days later, when they were coughing and sneezing, he gathered 37 more people and divided them into three groups. Group 1 members spent three days and nights in the same room with one of the infected students, separated by a screen so they couldn't touch one another. Group 2 sat around a table while an infected volunteer talked, coughed and sang to them. Group 3 held hands with an infected student for ten seconds, and then touched their own noses or eyes. Although most scientists at the time, the mid-70s, believed colds were spread by virus-laden droplets spread through the air when infected people coughed or sneezed, Gwaltney suspected physical contact might play an important role. Sure enough, of the 15 people who had touched a student volunteer, 11 became infected--compared with only one of those who had been sitting at the table, and none who had spent three days and nights together. \"The best evidence we have is that hand-to-hand contact is the most efficient way of transmitting virus,\" says Gwaltney. The study was one of a series that helped establish Gwaltney's reputation as a leading authority. Dr. Robert Couch says, \"It would not be inappropriate to call him Mr. Common Cold.\" When Gwaltney is asked how close scientists are to finding a cure, he replies: \"If you mean 'get rid of', I don't think we're going to be able to do that with cold viruses any time soon. But if you look in the dictionary, you'll see that 'cure' is explained as a successful treatment.

I was pleased with the pacing, the camera angles, etc. However, the characters? eh, kinda bland. Plot? It sucked.\n\nThis movie seemed more new age crap than anything else. Organized religion is presented as cowardly and fearful. Science isn't portrayed any better. It creates a monster weapon that kills everything... but \"souls\" have the power to destroy monsters and bring life? Really?\n\nThat's something that bites my ass a bit too. Here we have a CGI movie... created with science... and they're using it to give us the message that science will destroy the world while promoting the idea that spirituality will save us? At least they had the decency to have one of the characters ask,\n\n\"Okay, so now what?\" (or something similar). I couldn't hear it too well because of the crowd immediately getting up and making a break for the exit. It was a \"okay... it was just barely entertaining enough to sit here for the entire movie but now let's get out of here as fast as possible!\" type of exit.\n\nThis is one of those movies where you can't think if you want to enjoy it. Just look at the visuals and nod your head prettily. Any thought as to, \"what's the point of that?\" will suck you out of disbelief and make you eye the exit sign with longing.\n\nOkay... SPOILERS follow.\n\nSo, basically, a scientist creates \"the Machine\" that is capable of creating other, intelligent, robotic life. Evil humans use it as a weapon. However, the scientist realizes that he is also at fault. He gave the Machine his intellect, but didn't give it his heart. \n\nThe Machine goes Skynet on humanity's collective ass and wipes out all life on earth, finally slowly powering down. However, the scientist manages to survive and create walking sock-puppets. Each one, containing a piece of the scientist's soul.\n\nThe last one, #9 wakes up not knowing anything about the world. He sees a strange device nearby and picks it up. He meets up with another like himself, #2. \n\nWell, #2 gets captured by a last surviving robot of the Machine. #9 finds more like himself ands sets off to rescue #2. \n\nThey succeed.\n\n#9 notices that there is a matching hole that fits the device perfectly. He inserts it and the Machine comes back to life... pulling out #2's soul in the process.\n\nThe movie then continues with action scenes with #9 trying to rescue his soul-yanked compatriots. \n\nThey eventually succeed and destroy the Machine. They release the souls of their fallen friends, who go up into the clouds. It then rains and we see life returning back to the planet.\n\nHunh?!?\n\nThat makes no sense. None at all. Why the heck did the scientist want to split his soul into 9 homunculi? What did it accomplish? Were they created to stop the machine? Everything is dead! The machine was dead! Why bother?!?\n\nWhy did he expect nine little critters to succeed when nothing else had? Why not create a second intellectual machine, but with a \"soul\" to fight the first.. at least that would have seemed like it would have had a reasonable chance at success.\n\nWhy did they have to have their souls sucked into the device by the Machine and then destroy the Machine and then release the souls in order to bring life back to earth?

Daryl Hall is generally the lead vocalist; John Oates primarily plays electric guitar and provides backing vocals. The two write most of the songs they perform, separately or in collaboration. They achieved their greatest fame from the late 1970s to the mid-1980s with a fusion of rock and roll and rhythm and blues.\nContext: Their next album, H2O, a very polished, synth-heavy effort, became the duo's most successful album, with US sales eventually approaching four million copies. H2O reached #3 on the Billboard album chart (where it held for 15 weeks) and spawned three Top 10 singles. \"Maneater\", the biggest hit of their career, reached Number 1 on December 18, 1982 and stayed there for four weeks.  The soulful ballad \"One on One\" and a cover of Mike Oldfield's \"Family Man\" reached Number 7 and Number 6 in March and June 1983, respectively.  According to John Oates, they recorded approximately 20 songs for the album, of which 9 didn't make the final cut. He went on to say they usually would have 5 or 6 tracks left over per album.  \"One On One,\" with its clever mixed-metaphorical references to romance and basketball, was used in NBA commercials of the period. The commercial featured numerous players, including Hall of Famer James Worthy performing a 360-degree slow-motion lay-up during the saxophone solo.  For the H2O album, Hall and Oates made some permanent changes to their current band. Drummer Mickey Curry, who had appeared on some Private Eyes tracks, including the title song, replaced Jerry Marotta full-time. Bassist Tom \"T-Bone\" Wolk, who had mimed John Siegler's bass line in the \"Private Eyes\" video, replaced Siegler full-time. These two joined the band's holdovers--lead guitar player G.E. Smith, and saxophonist Charlie \"Mr. Casual\" DeChant.

In anticipation of this economic boon, the city and a private developer spent $13 million to renovate the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad (DL&W) station and transform it into a Hilton hotel, at a time when the unemployment rate in the city was 13 percent.  Only 60,000 visitors showed up at Steamtown in 1987, and the 1988 excursions were canceled. After only three years, it was $2.2 million in debt and facing bankruptcy.

Yet , this retirement was not complete and Hisamasa managed to hold some sway of the clan . This surfaced in 1570 after Oda Nobunaga who was allied with his son , Azai Nagamasa , attacked Asakura Yoshikage who had supported Hisamasa against enemies like the Rokkaku clan . Hating Nobunaga for his personality , Hisamasa demanded that the Azai clan pay back the support of Asakura clan and forced a war by breaking the alliance . It is thought that Nagamasa opposed him and believed that the alliance could somehow be mended over time since he refused to divorce his wife , Oichi , but he failed to gain enough support to overturn Hisamasa .

Nevertheless, an unusual situation occurred in the Kamakura period (11991333) upon the death of the first shogun, whereby the Hj clan's hereditary titles of \"shikken\" (1199-1256) and \"tokus\" (12561333) monopolized the shogunate as dictatorial positions, collectively known as the .

Many people lost their lives, and some are still missing. The first people who were found were in Amatrice.

However, this water isn't cold enough so he puts it into the freezer to cool it down.

He comes back two hours later after the phone call to get his cups of water back.  But I can use this background: This is how ice wedging works. When liquid water changes into solid ice, it increases in volume. You see this when you fill an ice cube tray with water and put it in the freezer. The ice cubes go to a higher level in the tray than the water. You also may have seen this if you put a can of soda into the freezer so that it cools down quickly. If you leave the can in the freezer too long, the liquid expands so much that it bends or pops the can. (For the record, water is very unusual. Most substances get smaller when they change from a liquid to a solid.)  What is an answer for this question: Which cup is more likely to get a crack in it?\nA:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The cup that is more likely to get a crack in it is the red cup. This is because the red cup has been left on the table for two hours without being taken a sip, allowing the water inside to expand and potentially crack the cup.

I wondered if I would ever be able to escape the darkness that had enveloped me, or if I would be forever trapped in this state of unconsciousness. As I drifted further into the abyss, I felt a faint glimmer of hope, a flicker of light that seemed to pierce the darkness.\n\nI was not sure if it was a dream or a vision, but I knew that I had to hold onto it. I clung to the thought that perhaps there was a way out of this predicament, that I was not doomed to remain in this state of helplessness forever. I tried to focus on the light, to let it guide me through the darkness and lead me to the safety that I so desperately sought.\n\nAs I continued to drift, I began to feel a strange sensation.

The sky above was a brilliant shade of blue, and the sun shone down on me with a warmth that seemed to radiate through my very soul.\n\nAs I looked around, I realized that I was not alone. There were others like me, people who had also been affected by the gas that had robbed them of their strength and will to fight. We stood together, united in our shared experience, and I felt a sense of camaraderie that I had never known before.\n\nTogether, we began to explore this new world, to discover its secrets and uncover its mysteries. We found that we had been granted powers that we had never known we possessed, and we used them to help one another and to protect those who were still trapped in the darkness.\n\nAs time passed, I began to realize that this new world was not just a dream or a vision, but a reality that had been created by the gas that had once held me captive. The gas had given us a second chance, a chance to live a life free from the limitations that had once held us back.\n\nIn this new world, I had found a sense of purpose and belonging that I had never known before. I had found a community of people who understood me, who accepted me for who I was, and who had given me the strength to overcome the darkness that had once threatened to consume me.\n\nAs I looked back on my journey, I realized that the gas that had once robbed me of my strength had ultimately given me the greatest gift of all: the chance to live a life that was truly free.

However, their contrasting approaches to their bodies often led to heated debates between them.\n\nStep 1: Establish the contrasting approaches\nNeil believed that showing off his muscular torso was a way to showcase his dedication to fitness and his hard work in the gym. He would often wear tight-fitting shirts or go shirtless altogether, proudly displaying his toned abs and bulging biceps.\n\nOn the other hand, Kenneth preferred to keep his shirt on at all times, even during workouts. He believed that showing off his body was unnecessary and that it was better to let his actions speak for themselves. He was more focused on the progress he made in the gym and the benefits it brought to his overall health and well-being.\n\nStep 2: Introduce a catalyst for the conflict\nOne day, they both decided to participate in a local bodybuilding competition. Neil was excited to show off his impressive physique and prove that his dedication to fitness was worth it. Kenneth, on the other hand, was hesitant to participate, as he didn't want to draw attention to himself or his body.\n\nStep 3: Develop the conflict\nAs the competition approached, the tension between Neil and Kenneth grew. Neil would often brag about his training routine and the results he had achieved, while Kenneth would dismiss his efforts as unnecessary. They both had different opinions on what it meant to be fit and healthy, and their contrasting approaches to their bodies only added to the conflict.\n\nStep 4: Resolve the conflict\nOn the day of the competition, Neil and Kenneth both stood on the stage, ready to showcase their strength and physiques. Neil wore a tight-fitting shirt that accentuated his muscles, while Kenneth opted to wear a full-body suit to hide his body.\n\nAs the competition progressed, it became clear that both Neil and Kenneth had different strengths and weaknesses. Neil's focus on building muscle mass made him a formidable competitor, while Kenneth's dedication to overall fitness and health gave him an edge in endurance and agility.\n\nIn the end, both Neil and Kenneth were able to showcase their unique approaches to fitness and health. They learned that there was no one-size-fits-all approach to fitness, and that both their methods had their own merits.\n\nStep 5: Conclude the story\nFrom that day on, Neil and Kenneth put aside their differences and focused on supporting each other in their fitness journeys. They continued to participate in competitions and share their knowledge and experiences with others, inspiring others to find their own unique path to fitness and health."}]}

The context provided suggests that the person is living in an apartment building, which is a type of walk-up building. Walk-up buildings are typically smaller than skyscrapers, malls, or tall buildings, and they are designed for people to walk up the stairs to their apartment on each floor.\n\nApartment buildings are a type of residential housing that consists of multiple units, each with its own living space, kitchen, bathroom, and bedrooms. These buildings are usually located in urban or suburban areas and are often found in close proximity to shopping centers, schools, and public transportation.\n\nIn contrast, skyscrapers are tall, multi-story buildings that are designed for commercial or residential use. They are usually found in urban areas and are often used for office spaces, hotels, or residential living. Skyscrapers are much larger than apartment buildings and are built with elevators to transport people and goods between floors.\n\nMalls are large shopping centers that are designed for retail purposes.

Names can identify a class or category of things, or a single thing, either uniquely, or within a given context. A personal name identifies, not necessarily uniquely, a \"specific\" individual human. The name of a specific entity is sometimes called a proper name (although that term has a philosophical meaning also) and is, when consisting of only one word, a proper noun. Other nouns are sometimes called \"common names\" or (obsolete) \"general names\". A name can be given to a person, place, or thing; for example, parents can give their child a name or a scientist can give an element a name.  - A pseudonym (and ) or alias is a name that a person or group assumes for a particular purpose, which can differ from their original or true name (orthonym). Pseudonyms include stage names and user names (both called \"screen names\"), ring names, pen names, nicknames, aliases, superhero identities and code names, gamer identifications, and regnal names of emperors, popes, and other monarchs. Historically, they have often taken the form of anagrams, Graecisms, and Latinisations, although there are many other methods of choosing a pseudonym.  - A monarch is the sovereign head of state in a monarchy. A monarch may exercise the highest authority and power in the state, or others may wield that power on behalf of the monarch. Typically a monarch either personally inherits the lawful right to exercise the state's sovereign rights (often referred to as \"the throne\" or \"the crown\") or is selected by an established process from a family or cohort eligible to provide the nation's monarch. Alternatively, an individual may become monarch by conquest, acclamation or a combination of means. A monarch usually reigns for life or until abdication.   - A regnal name, or reign name, is a name used by some monarchs and popes during their reigns, and used subsequently to refer to them. The term is simply the adjective \"regnal\", of or relating to a reign, monarch, or kingdom, modifying \"name\". Since ancient times, monarchs have frequently, but not always, chosen to use a different name from their original name when they accede to the monarchy. The regnal name is usually followed by a regnal number (ordinal), usually written as a Roman numeral (VI rather than 6), to provide a unique identification for that monarch among other monarchs of that realm. In some cases, the monarch has more than one regnal name, but the regnal number is based on only one of those names, for example Charles X Gustav of Sweden, George Tupou V of Tonga. If a monarch reigns in more than one realm, he or she may carry different ordinals in each one, as they are each assigned chronologically, and some realms may have had different numbers of rulers of the same regnal name previously. For example, the same person was both King James I of England (along with Ireland) and King James VI of Scotland.  - Dead Run is the third book by mother and daughter authors P. J. Tracy. It follows on from their first and second books, \"Want to Play?\" and \"Live Bait\" and has the same principal characters.  - In modern popular fiction, a superhero (sometimes rendered super-hero or super hero) is a type of costumed heroic character who possesses supernatural or superhuman powers and who is dedicated to fighting crime, protecting the public, and usually battling supervillains. A female superhero is sometimes called a superheroine (also rendered super-heroine or super heroine). Fiction centered on such characters, especially in American comic books since the 1930s, is known as superhero fiction.  - A pen name (\"nom de plume\", or \"literary double\") is a pseudonym (or, in some cases, a variant form of a real name) adopted by an author and printed on the title page or by-line of his or her works in place of their \"real\" name. A pen name may be used to make the author's name more distinctive, to disguise his or her gender, to distance an author from some or all of his or her previous works, to protect the author from retribution for his or her writings, to combine more than one author into a single author, or for any of a number of reasons related to the marketing or aesthetic presentation of the work. The author's name may be known only to the publisher, or may come to be common knowledge.  - A stage name, also called a screen name, is a pseudonym used by performers and entertainers such as actors, comedians, and musicians.  - Monkeewrench (released later in the United Kingdom as \"Want to Play?\"), is the first novel by author team P. J. Tracy. It revolves around the search for a copycat killer, who is recreating murders found in a new computer game. It also seems that the killer is linked to the computer programmers who made the game.  - The pope (from \"pappas\", a child's word for \"father\") is the Bishop of Rome and, therefore, the leader of the worldwide Catholic Church. The primacy of the Roman bishop is largely derived from his role as the traditional successor to Saint Peter, to whom Jesus is supposed to have given the keys of Heaven and the powers of \"binding and loosing\", naming him as the \"rock\" upon which the church would be built. The current pope is Francis, who was elected on 13 March 2013, succeeding Benedict XVI.  - An anagram is direct word switch or word play, the result of rearranging the letters of a word or phrase to produce a new word or phrase, using all the original letters exactly once; for example, the word anagram can be rearranged into nag-a-ram. Someone who creates anagrams may be called an \"anagrammatist\". The original word or phrase is known as the \"subject\" of the anagram. Anagrams are often used as a form of mnemonic device as well.  - An emperor (through Old French \"empereor\" from ) is a monarch, usually the sovereign ruler of an empire or another type of imperial realm. Empress, the female equivalent, may indicate an emperor's wife (\"empress consort\"), mother (\"empress dowager\"), or a woman who rules in her own right (\"empress regnant\"). Emperors are generally recognized to be of a higher honour and rank than kings. In Europe the title of Emperor was, since the Middle Ages, considered equal or almost equal in dignity to that of Pope, due to the latter's position as visible head of the Church and spiritual leader of Western Europe. The Emperor of Japan is the only currently reigning monarch whose title is translated into English as \"Emperor\".  - A ring name is a stage name used by a professional wrestler, martial artist, or a boxer. While some ring names may have a fictitious first name and surname, others may simply be a nickname from the moves that they do or their talents in the ring.  - P. J. Tracy is a pseudonym for American mother - daughter writing team Patricia ( P. J. ) and Traci Lambrecht . Their novels include Monkeewrench ( published as Want to Play ? in the UK ) , Live Bait , Dead Run , Snow Blind and Shoot to Thrill ( published as Play to Kill in the UK ) .

Now I am on a search to see every film by Miyazaki. One of his earlier works is \"Castle in the Sky.\" Although it's still enjoyable, it's not as good as \"Spirited Away\" (though comparing this or any film to his 2002 masterpiece is perhaps unfair).A young boy named Pazu (James Van Der Beek) is working in a mine late one night, when he sees a girl fall slowly from the sky. When she wakes up the next morning, she introduces herself as Sheeta (Anna Paquin). But Sheeta has a secret, and before he knows it, Pazu is pulled into an adventure that will lead him into danger with pirates, the army and a lost floating city.Going into a film by Hayao Miyazaki means you can expect one thing: a sense of wonder and magic. Many filmmakers have tried, but no one can create a sense of magic and awe like Miyazaki. Watching a film by Miyazaki is like experiencing a fantastic dream from your childhood.Because the film is animated, dubbing the film does not pose much of a problem because it is next to impossible to determine whether or not the lip movements match up to the words. It also helps that the translated dialogue is well-written and voiced by talented actors. The voice acting is varied. James Van Der Beek fares best. He brings an irresistible enthusiasm and excitement to the role of Pazu that is perfect for the character. Anna Paquin is nearly as good as Sheeta. She's frightened by the events going on around her, but she knows what she has to do. Mark Hamill is unrecognizable as the evil Muska. He's dangerous and wants something from Sheeta, and will do anything to get it. The other voices are bad. Cloris Leachman is awful as Dola. Leachman may have won an Oscar for \"The Last Picture Show,\" but she's annoying as the pirate leader. Leachman gives the character an obnoxious squawk that's nearly always monotonous. It's so bad it nearly ruins the film! Jim Cummings is an effective voice-over actor, but he's miscast as the general.I would definitely recommend seeing \"Castle in the Sky.\" I'll probably end up buying it myself. But even though it's not as good as \"Spirited Away,\" it's still pretty good. Question: is it a positive review?\nA:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yes"}]}

Question: Where was Margaret sent after her arrest? Title: The Great Raid Movie plot: In 1944, American forces were closing in on the Japanese-occupied Philippines. The Japanese held around 500 American prisoners who had survived the Bataan Death March in a notorious POW camp at Cabanatuan and subjected them to brutal treatment and summary execution, as the Japanese view surrender as a disgrace. Many prisoners were also stricken with malaria. The film opens with the massacre of prisoners of war on Palawan by the Kempeitai, the Imperial Japanese military's secret police (though factually, it was committed by the Japanese Fourteenth Area Army). Meanwhile, at Lingayen Gulf, the 6th Ranger Battalion under Lt. Col Mucci is ordered by Lt. Gen. Walter Krueger to liberate all of the POWs at Cabanatuan prison camp before they are killed by the Japanese. The film chronicles the efforts of the Rangers, Alamo Scouts from the 6th Army and Filipino guerrillas as they undertake the Raid at Cabanatuan. Throughout the film, the viewpoint switches between the POWs at Cabanatuan, the Rangers, the Filipino resistance and the Japanese. In particular, the film covers the resistance work undertaken by nurse Margaret Utinsky, who smuggled medicine into the POW camps. The Kempeitai arrested her and sent her to Fort Santiago prison. She was eventually released, but spent six weeks recovering from gangrene as a result of injuries sustained from beatings.\nThe answer is:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Can't answer"}]}

However, he has to postpone the wedding after he learns of a strange windfall. His deceased uncle has left him $8 million, but he can inherit the money only if he can spend a million of it before his 30th birthday, only two months away by October 13, 1944, without keeping any assets. The lawyer explains that Brewster's relative hoped it would make him so sick of spending that the rest of the fortune would not be wasted. The conditions include not telling anyone what he is doing. Brewster reluctantly agrees. Brewster sets up his own investment company called Brewster &amp; Company and hires his wartime buddies Hacky Smith (Joe Sawyer) and Noppy Harrison (Herbert Rudley) as vice presidents and Peggy as his private secretary. However, despite his best efforts, most of his schemes to lose money become profitable. Worse, Peggy becomes jealous of Brewster spending a great deal of time with first socialite Barbara Drew (Gail Patrick), then showgirl Trixie Summers (June Havoc), even though he is only using them to help squander the million. Smith and Harrison (mistakingly thinking that Brewster has gone crazy due to his spending sprees), begin to thwart all of his spending schemes.

During the cruise, Smith and Harrison stage a rebellion by confining Brewster to his quarters and ordering Brewster's chartared yacht turned around to return to New York, thinking that Brewster has lost his mind by financing this pointless cruise.

The first question is asking about two black dots near the front camera of an iPhone, while the second question is asking about an orange dot on the iPhone email.

The autofocus system uses these points to calculate the distance between the camera and the subject in the image, allowing for better focus and sharpness.\n\nOn the other hand, the orange dot on the iPhone email is likely a reference to the \"Read Receipt\" feature. This feature allows the sender of an email to see if the recipient has opened the email.

The usurping King Roderick (Cecil Parker) wishes his daughter, Princess Gwendolyn (Angela Lansbury), to marry his neighbour, Sir Griswold of MacElwain (Robert Middleton), and to enlist Griswold's aid against the band of forest rebels. Princess Gwendolyn refuses, since she dreams of a more handsome, gallant lover, and her personal maid Griselda (Mildred Natwick), who is a witch, has predicted that her true love will arrive at the castle to court her. The Griswold marriage plan also displeases Lord Ravenhurst (Basil Rathbone), who fears that Griswold's presence may cost him his privileged position with the king. The Black Fox orders Hawkins to carry the infant-king across the country to safety, accompanied by his captain, the maid Jean. On the journey, a romance blossoms between Hawkins and Jean.

It's an annual habit, and if often kicks off new ideas that might affect my team's next year of work. The good answer is: yes, there is less travel! And not just that, but having reduced the schlepping I do, I've been able to hire more amazing people to lead on our work, and celebrate one of NoTosh's best years ever in terms of the quality, quantity and breadth of work we're doing. Key to traveling less has been a marked increase in the number of folk who see and are now reaping the value of working with us online. I've avoided as many as 20,000 miles of travel thanks to greener clients, who are also many dollars better off having not paid for the airmiles that are wrapped up in our regular fee structure. The quality of our work is better, too, thanks to this. We are doing fewer of those day-long workshops with teachers or leaders, when an hour or even thirty minutes before the day gets started is more worthwhile. We're seeing more school leaders take this up, although it's harder to get teachers into the habit of taking 30 minutes 'me time' to jump into a coaching session on the day or week ahead. But it's starting, and the value to us all is huge. Coaching is very different to 'consulting a Personal Learning Network' on Twitter. It's intense, targeted, focussed and involves a one-on-one discussion that arrives quickly at resolutions to current day challenges that will have a long-term impact. And we come back to measure whether that impact actually happened. I don't think it's a way of working that many are used to in Education, although many corporate clients have had some rare experience with it.

Using a fish spatula to flip the fish. This method is straightforward, efficient, and does not require any additional preparation or cooking techniques.\n\nHere's a detailed explanation of why using a fish spatula is the best option:\n\n1. Fish spatula: A fish spatula is a flat, flexible, and lightweight tool specifically designed for flipping fish in a pan. It has a wide, flat blade that allows for easy and gentle flipping without damaging the fish. This tool is essential for preventing fish from sticking to the pan, as it helps to distribute the heat evenly and prevents the fish from burning or sticking.\n\n2. Soaking in salt water: While soaking the fish in salt water can help to remove any excess mucus and improve the flavor, it does not directly address the issue of sticking to the pan. Additionally, this method requires a longer cooking time and may not be suitable for all types of fish.\n\n3. Cooking in a wok: Although cooking in a wok can be an effective method for cooking fish, it does not directly address the problem of sticking to the pan. A wok is a versatile cooking vessel that can be used for various cooking techniques, but it does not have any specific features that prevent fish from sticking to the pan.\n\nIn conclusion, using a fish spatula to flip the fish is the most effective and efficient method for preventing fish from sticking to the pan.

Lovecraft, with notable direct references to The Shadow Over Innsmouth and to Cthulhu himself, who is the subject matter of the song's chorus.  It is considered the heaviest track on the album, with the main riff emulating a beast dragging itself into the sea. The Black Sabbath-influenced guitars are downtuned, creating slow and moody ambiance. \"Welcome Home (Sanitarium)\" was based on Ken Kesey's novel One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest and conveys the thoughts of a patient unjustly caged in a mental institution. The song opens with a section of clean single strings and harmonics. The clean, arpeggiated main riff is played in alternating 44 and 64 time signatures. The song is structured with alternating somber clean guitars in the verses, and distorted heavy riffing in the choruses, unfolding into an aggressive finale. This structure follows a pattern of power ballads Metallica set with \"Fade to Black\" on Ride the Lightning and would revisit with \"One\" on ...And Justice for All.\"Disposable Heroes\" is an anti-war song about a young soldier whose fate is controlled by his superiors. With sections performed at 220 beats per minute, it is one of the most intense tracks on the record. The guitar passage at the end of each verse was Hammett's imitation of the sort of music he found in war films. The syncopated riffing of \"Leper Messiah\" challenges the hypocrisy of the televangelism that emerged in the 1980s. The song describes how people are willingly turned into blind religious followers who mindlessly do whatever they are told. The 136 beats per minute mid-tempo riffing of the verses culminates in a descending chromatic riff in the chorus; it increases to a galloping 184 beats per minute for the middle section that climaxes in a distorted scream of \"Lie!\". The title derives from the lyrics to the David Bowie song \"Ziggy Stardust\". \"Orion\" is a multipart instrumental highlighting Burton's bass playing.

Ted has a crush on local environmentalist Audrey, who wants to see a \"real tree\" more than anything in the world, and decides to find one in order to impress her. His energetic Grammy Norma secretly tells Ted the legend of the Once-ler, who will tell anyone about trees if they brought him fifteen cents, a nail, and a shell of a great-great-great grandfather snail. When Ted leaves Thneedville in search of the Once-ler, he discovers that the outside world is a contaminated, empty wasteland. Once the boy finds him, the Once-ler agrees to tell Ted about the trees on the condition that he listens to the story over multiple visits. Ted agrees, but on his way home, he encounters the mayor of Thneedville, Mr. Aloysius O'Hare, who is also the proprietor of a company that sells bottled oxygen to Thneedville residents. O'Hare explains to Ted that because trees produce oxygen free of charge, he considers it a threat to his business whenever he hears people talking about them. After revealing that he has \"security camera eyes\" all over the city, O'Hare pressures Ted to stay in town. However, Ted continues to sneak out of O'Hare's sight (with his grandmother's encouragement) and learns more of the trees' history. Over Ted's various visits, the Once-ler recounts the story that when he was a young man, he departed his family to find good material for his Thneed invention and make a business.

Article: Can dogs help with OCD? You might watch and laugh when your dog chases its tail because it looks cute. But did you know that, even though it might appear like a fun game, it could mean your pet is sick? Researchers have found that if a dog runs after its tail, chases cars and barks  at flies that are not there, it may have obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD, ). In fact, OCD is even more common among humans. The symptoms   are varied: some people check and recheck the locks before they go out; others are extremely afraid of germs   and have to wash their hands many times a day. English soccer star David Beckham, for example, cannot stand odd numbers   of items in his fridge. So if he has three cans of drink he will throw one out, according to his wife Victoria. Hoping to better understand OCD in humans, a team of scientists from the University of Helsinki, Finland, studied 368 dogs, including those that chase their tail for several hours daily or a few times a month, according to Sciencedaily.com. They also examined dogs that had never chased their tails. Scientists took the dogs' blood sample   and asked their owners some questions about their pets' daily life. Findings showed that among all kinds of dogs, bull terriers   and German shepherds   were likely to chase their tails, which led scientists to believe that genes   can cause OCD. Diet also plays a part. It was found that dogs that eat food with certain vitamins and minerals chased their tails less. \"Interestingly, there are indications   that vitamins and minerals are helpful in human OCD treatment,\" said researcher Katriina Tiira. Moreover, tail-chasing is often found among dogs that were separated from their mothers too early or ones that didn't receive enough care. They are also more likely to turn out to be shyer and more afraid of loud noises at a young age. The study can help us understand the causes of OCD in humans. \"Dogs share the same environment with humans, and large animals are physiologically   close to humans,\" said Hannes Lohi, leader...

He has a theory about connections he's noticed between operations in Venezuela, Saudi Arabia, and other locations around the world, but so far there's no response. Noon approaches, and it's his turn to go out for lunch. Since it's still raining, he ducks out the basement door (which is against regulations) and cuts through several back alleys to the deli. Meanwhile, the sedan out front quietly pulls away after signaling to 3 men (one is a mailman) waiting in the street. They move in with quiet determination and knock on the front door.

Article: How often do you let other people like a bad driver, a rude waiter, or an angry boss, change your mood  ? Sixteen years ago I learned a lesson. I got in a taxi, and we took off for Grand Central Station. We were driving in the right lane   when all of a sudden, a black car jumped out of a parking space right in front of us. My taxi driver used his brakes  , the tires made a loud noise, and at the very last moment our car stopped just 3cm from the back of the other car. I couldn't believe it. But then I couldn't believe what happened next. The driver of the other car, the guy who almost caused a big accident, turned his head around and he started shouting at us. I couldn't believe it! My taxi driver just smiled and waved at the guy. So, I said, \"Why did you just do that? This guy could have killed us!\" And this is when my taxi driver told me what I now call, \"The Law of the Garbage Truck\". He said, \"Many people are like garbage trucks. They run around full of garbage, full of anger and disappointment. As their garbage piles up, they look for a place to dump   it. And if you let them, they'll dump it on you.

The findings, the first to show differences in very young babies, suggest there is a biological basis to their preferences. Psychologists Dr Brenda Todd from City University London carried out an experiment involving 90 babies aged 9 months to 36 months. The babies were allowed to choose from seven toys. Some were typically boys' toys ---- a car, a digger, a ball and a blue teddy. The rest were girls' toys: a pink teddy, a doll and a cooking set. They were placed a meter away from the toys;and could pick whichever toy they liked their choice and the amount of time they spent playing with each toy were recorded. Of the youngest children (9 to 14 months), girls spent significantly longer playing with the doll than boys, and boys spent much more time with the car and ball than the girls did. Among the two and three-year-olds, girls spent 50 percent of the time playing with the doll while only two boys briefly touched it. The boys spent almost 90 percent of their time playing with cars, which the girls barely touched. There was no link between the parents' view on which toys were more appropriate for boys or girls, and the children's choice. Dr Brenda Todd said, \"Children of this age are already exposed to much socialization. Boys may be given 'toys that go' while girls get toys they can care for, which may help shape their preference. But these findings agree with the former idea that children show natural interests in particular kinds of toys. There could be a biological basis for their choices.

Debates were covered on front pages of college newspapers and emphasized in yearbooks, and team members even received the equivalent of athletic letters for their jackets. There even were rallies sending off the debating teams to matches. Yet, the debates never attained the broad appeal that athletics enjoyed. One reason may be that debates do not have a clear winner, as is the case in sports, and that scoring is subjective.

But to make money, you must be financially literate. \"It bothered me that I didn't understand this stuff,\" says Steve, \"so I read books and magazines about money management and investing, and I asked every financial whiz   I knew to explain things to me.\" He and his wife started applying the lessons: They made a point to _ . They never bought on impulse, always negotiated better deals (on their cars,cable bills, furniture) and stayed in their home long after they went for an expensive vacation. They also put 20 percent of their annual salary into investments. Within ten years, they were millionaires, and people were coming to Steve for advice. \"Someone would say, 'I need to refinance my house -- what should I do? 'A lot of times, I wouldn't know the answer, but I'd go to find it and learn something in the process,\" he says. In 2003, Steve quit his job to become part owner of a company that holds personal finance seminars for employees of corporations like Wal Mart. He also started going to real estate investment seminars, and it's paid off: He now owns $ 30 million worth of investment properties, including apartment complexes, a shopping mall and a quarry. \"I was an engineer who never thought this life was possible, but all it truly takes is a little self education,\" says Steve. \"You can do anything once you understand the basics.\" Question: Since Steve Maxwell became a millionaire, he   _  .

Aaliyah starred opposite martial artist Jet Li, playing a couple who fall in love amid their warring families. It grossed US$18.6 million in its first weekend, ranking number two at the box office. Aaliyah purposely stayed away from reviews of the film to \"make it easier on\" herself, but she heard \"that people were able to get into me, which is what I wanted.\" In contrast, some critics felt there was no chemistry between her and Jet Li, as well as viewing the film was too simplistic. This was echoed by Elvis Mitchell of The New York Times, who wrote that while Aaliyah was \"a natural\" and the film was conceived as a spotlight for both her and Li, \"they have so little chemistry together you'd think they're putting out a fire instead of shooting off sparks. Her role was well received by Glen Oliver by IGN who liked that she did not portray her character \"as a victimized female\" but instead \"as a strong female who does not come across as an over-the-top Women's Right Advocate.\" In addition to acting, Aaliyah served as an executive producer of the film's soundtrack, where she contributed four songs. \"Try Again\" was released as a single from the soundtrack; the song topped the Billboard Hot 100, making Aaliyah the first artist to top the chart based solely on airplay; this led the song to be released in a 12\" vinyl and 7\" single.

A camp was fortified at the Munychia to cover the evacuation, and it was suggested, but not agreed on, that the walls of the Acropolis should be razed. As the Venetian preparations to leave became evident, many Athenians chose to leave, fearing Ottoman reprisals: 622 families, some 4,000-5,000 people, were evacuated by Venetian ships and settled as colonists in Argolis, Corinthia, Patras, and Aegean islands. Morosini decided to at least take back a few ancient monuments as spoils, but on 19 March the statues of Poseidon and the chariot of Nike fell down and smashed into pieces as they were being removed from the western pediment of the Parthenon.

But can you believe that a school in England is using classical music to cut down students' bad behavior? The head teacher Brian Walker at the West Park School in Derby asks some students to stay behind after school on Fridays. He forces his students to listen to Mozart and other classical music. He also makes them copy his favorite poems and they have to watch educational videos. Mr. Walker says his main aim is to stop noisy pupils causing trouble in class for students who want to study. He said the students staying behind were \"not the smokers or drinkers, the truants   or the people who are late for school...It's those who have slowed the learning and teaching in class for everyone\". Mr. Walker said this was unacceptable, because it was making the rest of the students fail to focus their attention on their study. Mr. Walker believes what he does reminds students that education is something to value. \"It helps them see they are part of something bigger that will improve their life chances,\" he said. The head teacher thinks students in fact learn from being kept behind after school. \"Hopefully, I open their ears to an experience they don't normally have and don't want to have again, so it's both educational and acts as a warning.\" Music has had success elsewhere in reducing bad behavior.

The walls and ceilings, made of blocks of special sound-sucking materials, are more than three feet thick, while floor coverings are six-foot layers of feathers or cotton wool. Silence here can be as painful to the ears as the din(continuous loud noise) of a steelworks or a rocket blast-off, yet scientists get used to this and stay in these silent rooms for hours at a time, using microphones and electronic equipment to test the various materials being developed to make the world a less noisy place. Architects have used scientific discoveries to solve noise problem in a number of ways. Walls are hollowed (having empty space inside) and then filled with sound-sucking materials similar to cotton wool. Extra-thick carpets  cover the floors, and thick woolen curtains cover the windows. Air conditioning and heating channels are made less noisy by having the air passing through hundreds of tiny holes in baffles  made of sheets of soundsucking materials. Unfortunately, these techniques and others often work too well in some buildings. Noise-proof rooms become almost anechoic and people living in them are disturbed by the lack of sound.

W. Bailey, who wonders what it would be like if one of the 1930s/1940s Rex O'Herlihan movies were to be made today. At that point, in a scene reminiscent of The Wizard of Oz, the cinematography shifts from black and white to color and the soundtrack changes from mono to surround sound. As a consequence of this paradigm shift, Rex O'Herlihan, a \"singing cowboy\", is the only character aware of the plot outline. He explains that he \"knows the future\" inasmuch as \"these Western towns are all the same\" and that it's his \"karma\" to \"ride into a town, help the good guys, who are usually poor for some reason, against the bad guys, who are usually rich for some reason, and ride out again\". Rex's knowledge is also connected to the unspecified \"root\" vegetables he digs up and eats. On his high-stepping horse Wildfire, Rex rides into the town of Oakwood Estates, walks into a saloon and meets Peter, the Town Drunk. In exchange for a free drink, Peter explains the background: the town, and especially the sheep herders (\"nice enough, but they smell God-awful\"), are being terrorized by the cattle ranchers, headed by Colonel Ticonderoga.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Information:  - Storytelling is the social and cultural activity of sharing stories, often with improvisation, theatrics, or embellishment. Stories or narratives have been shared in every culture as a means of entertainment, education, cultural preservation and instilling moral values. Crucial elements of stories and storytelling include plot, characters and narrative point of view. The term 'storytelling' is used in a narrow sense to refer specifically to oral storytelling and also in a looser sense to refer to techniques used in other media to unfold or disclose the narrative of a story.  - An anecdote is a brief, revealing account of an individual person or an incident. Often humorous, anecdotes differ from jokes because their primary purpose is not simply to provoke laughter, but to reveal a truth more general than the brief tale itself, such as to characterize a person by delineating a specific quirk or trait, to communicate an abstract idea about a person, place, or thing through the concrete details of a short narrative. An anecdote is \"a story with a point.\"  - A short story is a piece of prose fiction that can be read in one sitting. Emerging from earlier oral storytelling traditions in the 17th century, the short story has grown to encompass a body of work so diverse as to defy easy characterization. At its most prototypical the short story features a small cast of named characters, and focuses on a self-contained incident with the intent of evoking a \"single effect\" or mood. In doing so, short stories make use of plot, resonance, and other dynamic components to a far greater degree than is typical of an anecdote, yet to a far lesser degree than a novel. While the short story is largely distinct from the novel, authors of both generally draw from a common pool of literary techniques.  - Oscar Fingal O'Flahertie Wills Wilde (16 October 185430 November 1900) was an Irish playwright, novelist, essayist, and poet. After writing in different forms throughout the 1880s, he became one of London's most popular playwrights in the early 1890s. He is remembered for his epigrams, his novel \"The Picture of Dorian Gray\", his plays, as well as the circumstances of his imprisonment and early death.  - The Picture of Dorian Gray is a philosophical novel by Oscar Wilde, first published complete in the July 1890 issue of \"Lippincott's Monthly Magazine\". The magazine's editor feared the story was indecent, and without Wilde's knowledge, deleted roughly five hundred words before publication. Despite that censorship, \"The Picture of Dorian Gray\" offended the moral sensibilities of British book reviewers, some of whom said that Oscar Wilde merited prosecution for violating the laws guarding the public morality. In response, Wilde aggressively defended his novel and art in correspondence with the British press, although he personally made excisions of some of the most controversial material when revising and lengthening the story for book publication the following year.  - `` The Canterville Ghost '' is a short story by Oscar Wilde , widely adapted for the screen and stage . It was the first of Wilde 's stories to be published . The story is about a family who moves to a castle haunted by the ghost of a dead nobleman , who killed his wife and was starved to death by his wife 's brothers .  - A novel is a long narrative, normally in prose, which describes fictional characters and events, usually in the form of a sequential story.  - Prose is a form of language that exhibits a grammatical structure and a natural flow of speech, rather than a rhythmic structure as in traditional poetry. Where the common unit of verse is based on meter or rhyme, the common unit of prose is purely grammatical, such as a sentence or paragraph.  - Fiction is the classification for any story or universe derived from imaginationin other words, not based strictly on history or fact. Fiction can be expressed in a variety of formats, including writings, live performances, films, television programs, animations, video games, and role-playing games, though the term originally and most commonly refers to the narrative forms of literature (see \"literary\" fiction), including the novel, novella, short story, and play. Fiction constitutes an act of creative invention, so that faithfulness to reality is not typically assumed; in other words, fiction is not expected to present only characters who are actual people or descriptions that are factually true. The context of fiction is generally open to interpretation, due to fiction's freedom from any necessary embedding in reality; however, some fictional works are claimed to be, or marketed as, historically or factually accurate, complicating the traditional distinction between fiction and non-fiction. Fiction is a classification or category, rather than a specific mode or genre, unless used in a narrower sense as a synonym for a particular literary fiction form.

Then she went into the kitchen and grabbed what she needed before going back up to her room quietly. She switched on the TV and started eating...and eating...for hours, until it was all gone. What Emily didn't know at the time was that she was suffering from an illness called binge-eating disorder(BED) . For years, Emily didn't tell anyone what she was doing. She felt ashamed, alone, and out of control. Why don't famous people confess   to BED, as they do to _ ? It's simple: There's a stigma involved. \"Overeating is seen as very bad, but dieting to be skinny is seen as positive and even associated with determination,\" says Charles Sophy, a doctor in Beverly Hills , California. \"Some parents or friends may look at a teen with BED and think, 'Oh, a good diet and some will-power will do the trick.' But that's not true,\" says Dr.Ovidio Bermudez , a baby doctor at the Eating Recovery Center in Denver. \"Eating disorders are real physical and mental health issues; it's not about willpower.\" The focus in treating BED shouldn't be on weight, because as with all eating disorders, the behaviors with food are a symptom of something deeper. Like most other diseases, genetics may play a big part in who gets BED and who doesn't. If you have a close relative with an eating disorder, that means you're more likely to develop an eating disorder of your own. Besides, many people with BED have tried at some point or another to control it by going on a diet, but paying more attention to food doesn't help. And it might even make things worse, like it did for Carla, who's 15 now and is recovering from BED. \"My parents would always tease me about my weight, so when I was 14, I went on a very restrictive diet,\" she says. When you can't have something, you only want it more, so every time Carla would have a bite of something that wasn't allowed on her strict diet. She would quickly lose control and binge  .\nThe answer to this question is:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "What is the main focus in treating binge-eating disorder (BED)?\n\nA.

The oxygenation process is essential for the survival of the body's cells, and any disruption in this process can lead to severe health complications.\n\nThe perturbation of less air getting into the lungs will have a direct effect on the first step of the oxygenation process, which is the intake of air into the lungs. This will result in a decrease in the amount of oxygen available for the lungs to extract. As a result, the lungs will not be able to remove as much oxygen from the air as they normally would.\n\nThis decrease in oxygen extraction will have a cascading effect on the subsequent steps of the oxygenation process. The oxygen that is not extracted from the air will not be transported to the bloodstream, and the hemoglobin in the red blood cells will not be able to bind to the oxygen. This will lead to a decrease in the number of red blood cells carrying oxygen throughout the body.\n\nAs a result, the number of blood cells in the body will be affected. The body will need to compensate for the reduced oxygenation by producing more red blood cells to carry oxygen to the cells. This will lead to an increase in the number of blood cells in the body.\n\nIn conclusion, the perturbation of less air getting into the lungs will have a significant effect on the oxygenation process and, consequently, the number of blood cells in the body.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Please answer the following question: Read the following article and select the best answer. Article: Great white sharks! Just hearing that name _ . In reality, these big fish have more to fear from us than we do from them. For many years, people killed countless great white sharks in the waters around the United States. But thanks to conservation   efforts, great whites are making a comeback in the U.S. Two recent studies show that the population of these sharks is rising along the east and west coast. Why is the growing population of a killer fish something to celebrate? \"When you fish too many of them, you start to lose balance in the environment,\" says shark researcher Tobey Curtis. As the biggest killer, sharks help keep the populations of fish, seals, and other creatures they eat from growing too large. In spite of their importance, great white sharks had long been hunted for their meat and their fins  . Then, in 1997, the U.S. government passed a law that didn't allow the hunting of great whites. Afterwards, the numbers of these sharks in the U.S. waters started to increase. The law wasn't the only thing that has helped great whites. Conservationists have also played a part in the sharks' comeback. The research group OCEARCH is using a method called tagging   to help change people's attitudes about great white. They let the public follow each shark as it travels the world's oceans. OCEARCH also gives each tagged shark a name to help people form a closer connection with the big fish. The group's most well-known shark is named Katharine. She was tagged last year near Cape Cod, Massachusetts. Since then, thousands of people have tracked Katharine's movements on Twitter and the OCEARCH website. This helps people see sharks in a new way. Chris Fischer, the founder of OCEARCH believes learning to appreciate great whites will encourage people to do more to protect them.

Earwigs have characteristic cerci, a pair of forceps-like pincers on their abdomen, and membranous wings folded underneath short forewings, hence the scientific order name, \"skin wings\". Some groups are tiny parasites on mammals and lack the typical pincers. Earwigs rarely use their flying ability.  - The japygids (family Japygidae) are a taxon of hexapods, of the order Diplura. In this family, the paired cerci at the end of their abdomens are pincer-like (superficially similar to the unrelated earwigs) and are used to catch their tiny prey. Seventy genera are recognised, divided among seven subfamilies.  - The order Diplura is one of the four groups of hexapods, alongside insects, springtails and Protura. They are sometimes called \"two-pronged bristletails\". Around 800 species have been described, of which around 70 occur in North America, 12 in Great Britain and two in Australia.

Article: Why are people interested in eating raw foods or whole foods   ? One reason is that eating these types of food reduces the risk of acid   accumulation in your body. Raw and whole foods are usually digested more efficiently than cooked foods. When we cook foods, we destroy the natural enzymes   that are part of the food in its raw form. These enzymes were intended by nature to help us digest the food. When we consume food without these natural enzymes, our bodies either digest the food improperly or allow too many nutrients to be absorbed into the bloodstream. In both instances, the result is overweight. When too many nutrients are absorbed at once, the body grows fat. Improperly digested food moves slowly through the digestive system, where it becomes increasingly acidic. To protect its vital organs from this acidic waste, the body changes the acid into fat and stores it safely away from the organs. Processed foods   contain chemical elements, which might confuse the appetite mechanism that tells us when we've had enough to eat; as a result, people often overeat. Processed foods also upset the digestive cycle. The body will either identify these foods as allergens and then store them safely away from the organs as fat, or the remains of undigested food will become acidic and enter the bloodstream as acid waste, which will stick to the blood vessel walls and block the passage of vital oxygen and nutrients heading for the body's cells. The body's metabolism   becomes inactive, and the result is weight gain and obesity. The accumulation of acid in the digestive system makes digestion increasingly inefficient. When that happens, even healthy foods can become acidic and the food allergies will become more common. To stop this vicious circle in its tracks, people need to consume food and supplements that will neutralize the acid already accumulated in body. Eating the right types of raw and whole foods can help. It's also important to restore your enzyme balance. You need to identify and avoid the foods that cause...

Born in Boston, she studied at Smith College and Newnham College at the University of Cambridge before receiving acclaim as a poet and writer. She married fellow poet Ted Hughes in 1956, and they lived together in the United States and then in England. They had two children, Frieda and Nicholas, before separating in 1962.\n\nAs Hughes and Plath were legally married at the time of her death, Hughes inherited the Plath estate, including all her written work. Hughes has been condemned repeatedly for burning Plath's last journal, saying he \"did not want her children to have to read it.\" He lost another journal and an unfinished novel and instructed that a collection of Plath's papers and journals should not be released until 2013. Hughes has been accused of attempting to control the estate for his own ends, although royalties from Plath's poetry were placed into a trust account for their two children, Frieda and Nicholas.  Still the subject of speculation and opprobrium in 1998, Hughes published Birthday Letters that year, his own collection of 88 poems about his relationship with Plath. Hughes had published very little about his experience of the marriage and Plath's subsequent suicide, and the book caused a sensation, being taken as his first explicit disclosure, and it topped best seller charts. It was not known at the volume's release that Hughes was suffering from terminal cancer and would die later that year. The book went on to win the Forward Poetry Prize, the T. S. Eliot Prize for Poetry, and the Whitbread Poetry Prize. The poems, written after Plath's death, in some cases long after, try to find a reason why Plath took her own life.  In October 2015 the BBC Two documentary Ted Hughes: Stronger Than Death examined Hughes' life and work and included audio recordings of Plath reciting her own poetry. Their daughter Frieda spoke for the first time about her mother and father.  In 2017 it was revealed that letters written by Plath between February 18, 1960 and February 4, 1963 claim that Hughes beat Plath two days before she had a miscarriage in 1961, and that Hughes told Plath he wished that she was dead.

A:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "There are 435 districts in the United States. These districts are known as congressional districts, and they are used to elect members of the United States House of Representatives. The number of districts is set by the Reapportionment Act of 1970, which was designed to ensure that each state has a number of representatives in the House of Representatives that is proportional to its population.\n\nThe number of districts in each state is determined by the state's population relative to the other states. The Reapportionment Act of 1970 established a formula for calculating the number of districts each state should have based on its population. This formula takes into account the state's population and the total number of districts in the House of Representatives.\n\nThe total number of districts in the House of Representatives is 435. This number is fixed by the Constitution of the United States, which states that \"The House of Representatives shall be composed of Members chosen every second Year by the Electors of each State, and the Electors in each State shall have the Qualifications requisite for Electors of the most numerous Branch of the State Legislature.\"\n\nEach state is allocated a number of seats in the House of Representatives based on its population relative to the other states. The number of seats each state has is determined by the following formula:\n\nNumber of seats = (Total seats in the House of Representatives / Total population of the United States) x State population\n\nThe total seats in the House of Representatives is 435, and the total population of the United States is determined by the decennial census. The state population is determined by the state's census count.\n\nUsing this formula, the number of seats each state has is then calculated. For example, if the total population of the United States is 328,239,523, and the state population is 10,711,908, the number of seats for that state would be:\n\nNumber of seats = (435 / 328,239,523) x 10,711,908\nNumber of seats = 0.00134 x 10,711,908\nNumber of seats = 14\n\nSo, the state would have 14 seats in the House of Representatives.\n\nIn summary, there are 435 districts in the United States, and these districts are used to elect members of the House of Representatives. The number of districts in each state is determined by the Reapportionment Act of 1970, which is based on the state's population relative to the other states."}]}

Turi and Lauper formed a band named Blue Angel and recorded a demo tape of original music. Steve Massarsky, manager of The Allman Brothers Band, heard the tape and liked Lauper's voice. He bought Blue Angel's contract for $5,000 and became their manager.  Lauper received recording offers as a solo artist, but held out, wanting the band to be included in any deal she made. Blue Angel was eventually signed by Polydor Records and released a self-titled album on the label in 1980. Lauper hated the album cover, saying that it made her look like Big Bird, but Rolling Stone magazine later included it as one of the 100 best new wave album covers (2003). Despite critical acclaim, the album sold poorly (\"It went lead\", as Lauper later joked) and the band broke up.

Question: suppose Less ice crystals collide with each other happens, how will it affect More ice crystals will get heavy and fall.  - A: more - B: less - C: no effect\nA:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "B: less\n\nIf there are fewer ice crystals colliding with each other, it will result in less ice crystals getting heavy and falling as snow. The process of ice crystal formation and their eventual fall as snow is a complex one, and it involves multiple factors.\n\nFirst, let's consider the initial stages of the process. When the air is cold, water vapor in the air condenses into tiny ice crystals. These ice crystals are extremely small and delicate, and they are constantly in motion due to the air currents and temperature fluctuations. As the ice crystals move around, they collide with each other. These collisions cause the ice crystals to stick together, forming larger ice crystals.\n\nNow, as more ice crystals stick together, they become too heavy to remain in the air. This is when they transform into snowflakes, which are the visible form of snow. The snowflakes then fall to the ground, where they accumulate and form snowfall.\n\nNow, if there are fewer ice crystals colliding with each other, it means that there are fewer opportunities for ice crystals to stick together and become larger. This, in turn, will result in fewer ice crystals becoming heavy enough to fall as snowflakes.\n\nTherefore, if there are fewer ice crystals colliding with each other, it will lead to less ice crystals getting heavy and falling as snow. This will result in less snowfall overall. So, the answer is B: less."}]}

The day goes smoothly until Jack is visited by a collection agency, claiming that he owes $95,000 in debts to their online gambling site. He trusts a colleague to take care of it (as he is convinced of some form of identity theft, which is later found out to be true and used to later set up Jack with a motive for robbing the bank) and goes out for a drink with colleague Harry Romano and potential employer, Bill Cox. Harry leaves in a taxi and Jack gets in his car. Unexpectedly, Cox follows him into the back seat. Cox then goes on to tell Jack that his family is being held hostage at their home to ensure Jack's cooperation. He then points a gun to Jack's head and forces him to drive home. Upon their arrival, Jack sees that, although his family is unharmed, they are under heavy watch by Cox's henchmen. Jack is not told what to do until the next morning, when he is told that he must give Cox $10,000 each from the bank's 10,000 largest depositors ($100 million total). He is outfitted with audio and video devices in the form of a pen and a body microphone, making any intentions to resist useless.

Today, we're going to learn how to make a compost garden. Compost is a special kind of soil that is made from kitchen scraps and other organic materials.

We'll use this hole to put our compost materials in. Make sure to dig a trench that is about 1 foot deep and 3 feet wide.\n\nStep 2: Fill it with kitchen scraps\nNow that we have our trench, it's time to fill it with kitchen scraps. Kitchen scraps are things like food waste, like apple peels, banana skins, and coffee grounds. We'll also add other organic materials like leaves, grass clippings, and even old newspapers. Make sure to fill the trench about 6 inches deep with these materials.\n\nStep 3: Cover the compost materials with soil\nAfter we've filled the trench with kitchen scraps, we need to cover them with soil. This is like putting a blanket over our compost. Make sure to cover the compost materials with about 3 inches of soil.\n\nStep 4: Move the trenches around each year\nFinally, we need to move the compost trenches around each year. This is like rotating our compost garden. We do this so that the compost materials get mixed up and become a nice, rich soil that plants can use.\n\nAnd there you have it! You now have your very own compost garden. Remember to keep adding kitchen scraps and other organic materials to keep it growing and healthy. Happy gardening!"}]}

The iPod line came from Apple's \"digital hub\" category, when the company began creating software for the growing market of personal digital devices. Digital cameras, camcorders and organizers had well-established mainstream markets, but the company found existing digital music players \"big and clunky or small and useless\" with user interfaces that were \"unbelievably awful,\" so Apple decided to develop its own. As ordered by CEO Steve Jobs, Apple's hardware engineering chief Jon Rubinstein assembled a team of engineers to design the iPod line, including hardware engineers Tony Fadell and Michael Dhuey, and design engineer Sir Jonathan Ive. Rubinstein had already discovered the Toshiba disk drive when meeting with an Apple supplier in Japan, and purchased the rights to it for Apple, and had also already worked out how the screen, battery, and other key elements would work. The aesthetic was inspired by the 1958 Braun T3 transistor radio designed by Dieter Rams, while the wheel based user interface was prompted by Bang & Olufsen's BeoCom 6000 telephone. The product (\"the Walkman of the twenty-first century\" ) was developed in less than one year and unveiled on October 23, 2001. Jobs announced it as a Mac-compatible product with a 5 GB hard drive that put \"1,000 songs in your pocket.\"\nIf it is possible to answer this question, answer it for me (else, reply \"unanswerable\"): in what year was the original iPod released?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The original iPod was released in 2001."}]}
