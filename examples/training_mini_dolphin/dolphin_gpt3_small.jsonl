Article: It's good to make mistakes,and here is why. First of all,mistakes are a clear sign that you are trying new things. It's always good to try new things because when you are trying new things you are growing. If you never try anything new,how can you improve?How can you expand?The simple answer is\"You can't.\"Look around you. With very few exceptions,either every-thing you see in your world or every single detail of every single thing is the result of someone trying something new. Another good thing about mistakes is this:When you are making mistakes,you are learning.Consider this:Edison failed 10,000 times before he perfected the 1ight bulb.When asked how it felt to fail that many times,he said that he hadn't failed 10,000 times,but rather had learned 10,000 things that didn't work. Finally,when you make a mistake you are much closer to success.Why?Because when all is said and done,you will have tried some numbers of things before you succeed.Every time you make a mistake you eliminate one of those things and are one step closer.But this all doesn't mean that you should go ahead without considering the consequences of a mistake.Quite the contrary,when you try something new you have to be willing to set some reasonable limits so that in the event that it doesn't work out the way you want it to,you will he in a position to try again. We all have limited time and money so don't blow them all on one approach to a problem.Realize that it probably won't be perfect the first time and allocate these resources properly so you can learn,make corrections,and try it again.If you accept and use your mistakes in this way,you can make great progress in your business and your career. There is an old saying that goes,\"If you're not making mistakes,you're not trying hard enough.\"So go ahead and make mistakes.And learn.And grow.And succeed. Question: What would the writer probably suggest we say to ourselves when we make a mistake? - Never mind,I can always try again - I'd better stay out of trouble - Ok!Now I can learn something - Look at this mess.Anyone would be upset\nA:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The writer would probably suggest that we say to ourselves, \"Ok! Now I can learn something\" when we make a mistake. The article emphasizes the importance of making mistakes as a way to learn and grow. The writer also suggests that we should set reasonable limits when trying new things so that we can allocate our resources properly and be in a position to try again if things don't work out.

The victory was seen as a major upset and a turning point in the Democratic primary race, which had previously been dominated by Obama's momentum following his win in the Iowa caucuses.\n\nClinton's victory in New Hampshire was attributed to a number of factors, including her emotional response to a question about her likability during a debate just days before the primary, as well as a strong ground game and a last-minute surge of support from female voters. The win gave Clinton a much-needed boost in the race and helped to solidify her position as a top contender for the Democratic nomination.\n\nDespite the setback in New Hampshire, Obama went on to win a number of key primary contests in the weeks and months that followed, ultimately securing the Democratic nomination and going on to win the presidency in the general election.

And while CEOs and presidents may generate the business headlines, an over-involved federal government hurts employees and those looking for jobs across the entire spectrum. As someone who grew up in poverty, watching his single mother work 16-hour days to provide as much as she possibly could for us, I have lived the power of the American Dream. With help from my mom and my mentor, I learned that I didn't have to be an entertainer or an athlete to achieve my goals; I could think my way out of poverty. I realized the power of education, and the incredible opportunities provided by free markets. Sen. Cory Booker: Finishing our nation's unfinished business . My fear is that too many folks these days aren't given the chance to see the greatness that resides within them. Over the past 50 years, we've seen the War on Poverty struggle in its core mission -- to help lift folks up. It's time for a change, so I have introduced my Opportunity Agenda. A significant part of my Opportunity Agenda is focused on job-training efforts. There are 4 million open jobs across the country right now -- jobs that are unfilled because of a skills gap in the work force. This in spite of the fact there are 35 federal work-force development programs. My SKILLS Act, which the House has already passed thanks to the efforts of Rep. Virginia Foxx, R-North Carolina, would cut through the bureaucratic maze and mountains of red tape that hinder these programs. We'll create one Workforce Investment Fund, cutting waste and duplication out while ensuring more dollars are used for their actual purpose -- job training. President Barack Obama signaled that Vice President Joe Biden would be looking at job-training programs this year -- I eagerly await their call to discuss my proposal. I am also working on a proposal to create opportunity zones across America to tie some of the tax dollars coming out of our low-income communities to the community itself in order to rebuild infrastructure and lift those areas up. In my time on county council in Charleston County, this concept was referred to as Tax Increment Financing (TIF) districts, and I see great potential in this concept at the federal level. It is not enough to simply rebuild, or as some would call it gentrify, our tougher neighborhoods -- we have to provide the opportunity to the folks living there already to take part in a brighter future. Population shifting isn't fixing the problem, it is simply moving it somewhere else. So instead of overtaxing and overregulating, I see a future where the government cuts out waste and duplication, and gives all Americans the chance to realize their full potential. As I travel throughout South Carolina, be it speaking with a local chamber of commerce, or a group of pastors, or working at a burrito store for a morning (verdict: my own skills with a broom could stand some polishing), my constituents are very clear: They don't want a handout, just a hand up. It isn't the federal government's responsibility to guarantee outcomes. It is, however, our responsibility to make sure that a better future is possible if people want it. Opportunity knocks for all of us at some point. My hope is that Washington doesn't get in the way of folks answering. Join us on Facebook.com/CNNOpinion.

These nutrients are then transported to the cells of the body, where they are used to produce energy in the form of ATP (adenosine triphosphate).\n\nWhen an animal needs to move, the muscles in its body contract and relax in a coordinated manner, allowing the animal to perform a wide range of movements, from running and jumping to swimming and flying.

Recently there has been something of a recovery in cycling , and in many areas it is a very useful way of getting around , especially where bike paths or bike routes have been built . You may well want to buy , hire or borrow a bike . There are two important results of this earlier drop in cycling in the USA . One is that many people do not know how to cycle . That is , cyclists often behave more like walkers than motorists : they ride in the sidewalk or on the wrong side of the road ; they do not care for stop signs or traffic lights ; they ride without lights at night ; they give no signals . The other result is that cycling is regarded by many people not so much as a way of getting from one place to another but as a way of life , a form of exercise , etc . As a result , large numbers of young Americans have ten-speed racing bikes . These are very high and fast and great if you are cycling long distance , riding up mountains or racing . At first , though , you may find them convenient for cycling in town , sightseeing or shopping --they are expensive , uncomfortable and hard to control until you get used to them , and unsuitable for rough stony roads . There are also ordinary bikes around . If you get hold of one of these ,you may find that the brakes  work by pedaling   backwards . This is perhaps safer than ordinary brakes when it is wet , but it seems to be less effective . This arrangement also means you can't pedal backwards in order to get the pedal in the right place for getting on or getting off .\nA:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "What is one of the important results of the drop in cycling in the USA during the 1950s and 1960s?\n\nA) Many people do not know how to cycle\nB) Cycling is only regarded as a form of exercise\nC) Young Americans only ride ten-speed racing bikes\nD) Bike paths and bike routes have not been built in many areas"}]}

D'Artagnan's enemy Rochefort (Christopher Lee) was caught spying and is enduring a wait before an amateur firing squad learning to load their rifles on the job. While they figure out how to blindfold a condemned man who has only one eye, Athos and Aramis prepare to launch a smoke bomb as cover while Porthos brings the horses for their escape, but the fuse goes out just as the order is given to fire. Fortunately the entire firing squad misses their target, and while they reload the trio manages to extract the spy. He is returned to his master, Cardinal Richelieu (Charlton Heston), then is sent to obtain D'Artagnan's lover Constance (Raquel Welsh). She is the dressmaker and confidante to Queen Anne (Geraldine Chapman) and a valued hostage if they are to deal with Anne's affair with the Protestant sympathizer, the Duke of Buckingham (Simon Ward).Rochefort and his men find D'Artagnan and Constance shopping in the public market. When she picks a melon from a basket, a hand appears from within and seizes her. While she is taken away, D'Artagnan engages his enemy in a duel and manages to deliver a slicing blow to Rochefort's hand; Rochefort upsets a cart of potatoes, which spills and buries D'Artagnan.

Article: It is commonly known that Japan went from a 19th century national economy to a 20th century global economy in a time span of 30 years between 1945 and 1975. What is less known is that Japan, understanding that fast, efficient transport was the key to a global economy, was the first country in the world to introduce the \"Bullet Train\". Kawasaki Heavy Industries was duly appointed the manufacturer and the first high speed train went \"on line\" in 1964. The Shinkansen, as is known in Japan, made its first journey between her capital and Osaka, a distance of 301 miles, at a speed of 132 mph. The next country to introduce high speed trains was France. SNGF, the public rail system in France, was losing passengers to other forms of transport and introduced the \"TGV\" (Train a Grande Vitesse) to counteract the trend in 1981. As a result of Opec controlling the oil market in 1974, the train was designed to be powered by gas turbines. It ran on a specially built track between Lyon and Paris. Eight years later another TGV was introduced, this time between the coast and Paris. Soon, France became the most rail efficient country in the world with high speed train connections to Belgium, London, Germany, Switzerland, Spain and the Netherlands. There was another positive element that resulted from the introduction of high speed trains. Between 1964 and 1991, Japan's Shinkansen had transported in excess of three billion passengers without there being a single fatal accident and eleven years after France introduced the TGV, it still had a 100% safety record. This statistic has never been equaled by the traditional slow moving trains in any country. China has become the fourth country to produce such trains, after France, Germany and Japan. China's first domestically produced bullet train with a maximum speed of 350 kilometers per hour has rolled off the production line. Equipped with highly-efficient power system, the currently fastest train in China is also energy efficient. When the train is running, it can transfer kinetic...

D: Crowded and expensive.\nThe answer to this question is:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Option C: Fast and safe. \n\nJustification: The article clearly states that Japan introduced the \"Bullet Train\" understanding that fast and efficient transport was the key to a global economy. The Shinkansen, as it is known in Japan, made its first journey between Tokyo and Osaka at a speed of 132 mph. The article also mentions that between 1964 and 1991, Japan's Shinkansen had transported in excess of three billion passengers without there being a single fatal accident. Similarly, France introduced the TGV to counteract the trend of losing passengers to other forms of transport and became the most rail efficient country in the world with high speed train connections to various countries. The article also mentions that 11 years after France introduced the TGV, it still had a 100% safety record. Therefore, the advantage of bullet train is that it is fast and safe. Option A is incorrect as the article mentions that the bullet train is highly efficient and energy efficient. Option B is incorrect as the article mentions that the bullet train is fast and safe, not slow. Option D is incorrect as the article does not mention anything about the bullet train being crowded or expensive."}]}

Plot title: Great Expectations Movie plot: 10-year-old Finnegan \"Finn\" Bell is playing on a beach in the Gulf Coast when an escaped convict suddenly pops out of the water and overpowers him, making Finn promise to bring back food, medicine and bolt cutters to get the iron shackles off his leg. Finn complies, and the convict unexpectedly tries to make Finn take him by boat to Mexico. The police seize the small boat heading out to sea. The convict hides on a buoy, and Finn's boat is towed back to shore. The next day, Finn sees on the news that the convict, mobster Arthur Lustig, had escaped from death row, but was recaptured and would face execution soon. Finn's uncle Joe Gargery is called to Paradiso Perduto (\"lost paradise\"), home of the richest woman in Florida, Mrs. Nora Dinsmoor. She is a local mystery, having shunned virtually all human contact since she was left at the altar several years before. She ostensibly asks him there to do a gardening job, but instead she slips him a large sum of money under the door, calling it \"gas money\". Meanwhile, Finn, who he brought along, meets Mrs. Dinsmoor's young niece Estella in the overgrown garden. Mrs. Dinsmoor sees them interacting and calls Maggie (Kim Dickens), Finn's sister, to ask her to let Finn be a playmate for Estella, even though Estella apparently dislikes him. On Finn's first visit, she is disappointed when the boy cannot dance for her, but is intrigued when he says he can draw. She forces Estella to sit for a portrait, which Finn draws with make up on an old piece of wallpaper. While he draws, Mrs. Dinsmoor warns Finn that he will fall in love with Estella and have his heart broken. After the portrait session, Mrs. Dinsmoor calls it a day and asks Estella to help Finn find the door. On the way out, she pauses to take a drink from a water fountain and politely offers him a drink from it as well. While Finn is drinking, Estella kisses him. Several years pass.

Police officer Max Walker has been offered a position with the TEC but is unsure whether or not to accept. While at home with his wife Melissa, he is attacked by unknown assailants and witnesses the house explode, killing her. Ten years later, Walker is a veteran of the TEC working under Commissioner Eugene Matuzak, who sends him back to 1929 to prevent his former partner, Lyle Atwood, from using knowledge of the future to financially benefit from the U.S. stock market crash. When confronted, Atwood admits to be working for Senator McComb, who needs the funds for his upcoming presidential campaign. Fearing that McComb will erase him from history, Atwood attempts to jump to his death, but Walker catches him mid-leap and returns to 2004. Refusing to testify, Atwood is sentenced to execution and is returned to 1929 where he resumes falling to his death. Walker is assigned a new partner, TEC rookie Sarah Fielding, and together they are sent back to 1994 to investigate McComb. They witness a meeting between young McComb and business partner Jack Parker, where McComb wishes to withdraw over a disagreement about a new computer chip. They are interrupted by the older McComb, who arrives from 2004 to stop the exchange claiming the chip will become highly profitable. Older McComb specifically tells his younger self not to touch him as the same matter cannot occupy the same space, and then kills Parker. Fielding turns on Walker, revealing that she works for McComb, and after a shootout Fielding is wounded and Walker escapes back to 2004. Walker returns to the TEC to find the future altered. McComb is now sole owner of the computer company and is a presidential front runner while the TEC is being shut down due to budget cuts.

These materials are often used in sensors, actuators, and other devices that require precise control of mechanical motion or electrical signals.\n\nWhile it is possible to use piezoelectric materials to generate electricity from the motion of machines, the amount of energy that can be generated is typically quite small.

They often reported on terrorist attacks and threats in a sensationalized way, which made people feel like they were in constant danger. Additionally, the US government used fear as a tool to justify their actions and policies in the \"war on terror\". This combination of media coverage and government messaging contributed to the overall sense of hysteria about terrorism in the US."}]}

Movie title: The Hitcher Movie plot: Jim Halsey, a young man delivering a car from Chicago to San Diego, spots a man hitchhiking in the West Texas desert and gives him a ride. The hitcher, John Ryder, is brooding and evasive; when Jim passes a stranded car, however, Ryder forces his leg down on the accelerator. Ryder calmly states he murdered the driver and intends to do the same to Jim. Terrified, Jim asks what Ryder wants. He replies, \"I want you to stop me.\" Ryder strokes Jim's face with a knife while telling him to say, \"I want to die.\" When Jim realizes that Ryder never put on his seat belt and the car's passenger door is ajar, he shoves him out of the door. Relieved, Jim continues on his journey. When he sees Ryder in the back of a family car, Jim tries to warn them but becomes involved in an accident. He later comes across the family's blood-soaked car and vomits. At a nearby abandoned gas station, Ryder corners Jim but simply tosses him the keys he took from Jim's car. After Ryder leaves with a trucker, Jim encounters him again at another gas station, where the trucks nearly runs him down as it crashes into the pumps. As Jim flees, Ryder ignites the spilled gas and causes the station to explode. At a roadside diner, Jim meets Nash, a waitress, and calls the police. As Jim relaxes, he finds a severed finger in his food and realizes Ryder is present. The police arrive and, after finding Ryder's knife in Jim's pocket, arrest him. Though the police doubt his guilt, they lock him up overnight as protocol. When Jim wakes, he finds the cell door is unlocked, and all the officers are dead. Jim panics, takes a pistol, and flees. At a gas station, he sees two officers, takes them hostage, and speaks to Captain Esteridge on the radio. As Esteridge convinces Jim to surrender, Ryder pulls up alongside them and kills the two officers. The patrol car crashes, and Ryder disappears again.

Several times, I have found the remains of quills where a tiger has killed and eaten a porcupine, but I have never actually seen the kill.In spite of the quills, experienced tigers will try to kill clearly by biting the porcupine's head, its weakest spot.But the quills are very sharp and can give painful injuries to young tigers.If the quills have gone in very deeply or if they are stuck in the tiger's paw, it will try to pull them out.Often, it will be successful, and the wound will get better.But, if the quills have gone in very deeply or if they are stuck in the tiger's neck or mouth, where they cannot be reached, the wound will often turn bad.If this happens, the tiger is in pain and is less able to hunt animals.It has to look for easier prey and so may turn to cows on the edges of the forest.From this, it is a small step to becoming a man-eater.

Seismic waves are waves of energy that travel through the Earth's crust and are caused by the sudden breaking and movement of rocks along a fault line. These waves can be felt on the surface as earthquakes and can cause significant damage to buildings, infrastructure, and the environment.\n\nThe release of seismic waves is the result of a complex series of events that occur when fault lines grow and rocks on either side of the fault line rub against each other, putting pressure on each other until they break. This breaking of the rocks releases a tremendous amount of energy, which is then transmitted through the Earth's crust as seismic waves.\n\nSeismic waves can be classified into two main types: body waves and surface waves. Body waves are waves that travel through the Earth's interior and include P-waves and S-waves. P-waves are compressional waves that travel faster than S-waves and can travel through both solid and liquid materials. S-waves are transverse waves that can only travel through solid materials.\n\nSurface waves, on the other hand, are waves that travel along the Earth's surface and include Love waves and Rayleigh waves.

A limping man named Bill Rachin, who works at the hotel, draws Kipp's suspicion. So does George Williams, a card dealer. Williams' wife, Alice, flirts with Kipp and tries to coax information out of him. Kipp does not reveal the purpose for his visit. Vance Edwards identifies Kipp and his reputation as a bounty hunter. Edwards mistakenly believes Kipp is seeking him for another crime. The townspeople become anxious as the truth about Kipp becomes known.

When it comes to the movement of objects, the surface on which they are moving plays a crucial role. In this case, the basement floor is made of cement, which is a hard and smooth material. On the other hand, the grassy backyard is covered with grass, which is a soft and uneven material.\n\nWhen an object moves on a smooth surface, there is less friction between the object and the surface. This means that the object can move more easily and with less resistance. In contrast, when an object moves on an uneven surface, there is more friction between the object and the surface. This makes it harder for the object to move and requires more effort.\n\nIn the case of Gabby's tricycle, the smooth surface of the basement floor allows it to move more easily and with less resistance. This means that Gabby can pedal her tricycle faster and with less effort.

The biggest difference is traffic rules. In America there are too much more cars than in China. But there are much fewer traffic jams and accidents in America than in China. We hardly see traffic police in the street, but all cars obey strictly traffic rules, and people hardly find that a car does not obey traffic rules in the street. About American traffic rules, there are many better terms, such as: 1. Stop line: There are stop lines in all crossing without traffic light (some have two stop lines and others have four stop lines). All cars must stop while meeting the stop line. 2. Traffic light: There is traffic light in the crossing of the road. Cars may almost turn every direction. The traffic light can give signal step by step including u-turn. There is a kind of middle lane of turning left. When a car wants to turn left in the road, he may enter into the middle lane of turning left and give a signal of turning left. When he thinks being safe, he may turn left. In many conditions the order of passing is also given very specifically. If people want to change lane or turn, they must look behind and think being safe. Only so, they may do it. 3. Specific item: Such as parking, there are three kinds of lines (their colors are white, blue or red) in the roadside. Every line may park different kinds of cars. There are many streets in some residential areas  , and there is a kind of rule that any car cannot park at any time or any period time. In every parking, there are some special positions for invalid   people. 4. About the priority of passenger and car: At any case, passengers have the priority to cars.

But, he really shouldn't have directed this movie, and the screenplay should've been rejected. The director and writers must understand what the original TV show was really about, as well as who the characters were and how they worked. The original series had many episodes with razor-sharp writing using good dialogue and with situations that American producers would never consider using in children's programming, much less a movie, which made the original series so well received by adults. I mean, the Tracys were college graduates and some of them did even drank alcohol and smoked tobacco! And, there were characters who did get killed, although most were bad guys. If they had written it the way that it was originally done, which isn't dumbing things down with poor dialogue, kindergarten humor, and a weak plot, this Universal/Studio Canal joint venture wouldn't have such bad reviews. \n\nThis motion picture is almost pure blasphemy. If you've seen the original Supermarionation series, then you'll know what I'm talking about! \n\nThe first thing that was out of place and annoying were the constant references to Ford Motor Company, even going so far that Lady Penelope was riding around in a disfigured Ford Thunderbird made up to look like FAB-1 instead of using what would've been more appropriate considering Ms. Penelope's station (not to mention being more faithful to the original), a ROLLS-ROYCE FAB-1. She's supposed to be a distinguished member of British society, hence the preference for England's finest make of motorcars in the original series. One other reviewer here indicated that Penelope wouldn't be caught dead in a Ford. He's pretty much right in the context that the idea of her riding in a Ford doesn't work. At least they could have had Penelope ride in a Jaguar made up like FAB 1 since Jaguar is a British car make that is owned by Ford, but NO! They had to use a straight FORD! But the Ford product placement doesn't end there. EVERY single car you may see is a Ford! Even the news flash that is shown on the TV sets in the movie were sponsored by Ford! Ford, Ford, FORD! The predominance of Ford vehicles makes this movie an obvious marketing vehicle for Ford. \n\nThe original series had a design that was futuristic for the 1960s and still remains ahead of its time even today. But, the futuristic design in the original series worked because there was an effort to make the design look practical and functional. This kind of treatment didn't exist in the movie, where everything is stylized to excess, defeating the sense of functionality and practicality. A lot of things that were done in the design of the movie were done strictly for style, many times with no sense of function to give that style a sense of reason.\n\nThe original series relied on good acting performances of the voice talent to overcome the limited expressions in the puppets, bringing them to life in the episodes. The brilliant and lively music score by Barry Gray helped even further to connect the audience with the story, the characters, and how everything came together to help achieve the super objective (a little bit of Stanislavski talk). The movie, on the other hand, had some overly grating performances. Anthony Edwards overplayed Brains to a fault, Bill Paxton as Jeff Tracy just didn't work despite decent acting (one of few), there were better choices for the Hood than Ben Kingsley, and many others that I don't care to mention (it would take too long). Quite simply, the puppets were more believable! Second was the overly generic and underwhelming music score by Hans Zimmer, sounding more like a mix between \"Days of Thunder\" and \"Apollo 13.\" \n\nAnd, of course, the Hood. The Hood in the original series had an ability to communicate with Kyrano through a statue of Kyrano as an outlet for ESP contact. But, that was where his extraordinary capability ended. He's a master of disguise and deception, which allows him to sneak around undetected (for the most part, anyways) to gather information of the Thunderbirds vehicles for his own means. He also uses weapons for his own defense, including pistols, and generally collects information using a film camera, although he tried to steal Thudnerbirds 1 and 2 in the 1960s United Artists release of \"Thunderbird 6\" (which was the last Thunderbirds show filmed in Supermarionation and was the second Thunderbirds theatrical release). But, while he is a nemesis of International Rescue, the Hood isn't the villain in every Thunderbirds episode and he tends to avoid direct confrontation with International Rescue. In the movie, he's obviously the main villain, but he and his cohorts seem to act more like morons, along with the Hood having extended mind control ability, including the ability to move objects and move himself into flight for brief periods of time. This totally deviates from the Hood as a character in the original series with one that may leave kids laughing and people familiar with the series scratching their heads in confusion or leaving the theater in disgust.\n\nThere are more criticisms, but the 1000 word limit for IMDb reviews will not allow me to list all of them. So, I will close with the point being made that I didn't enjoy this movie. As a matter of fact, I think it sucks! Having seen the original series and Supermarionation movies (Thunderbirds Are Go, Thunderbird 6), I was hoping for something a lot better than this.\n\nThe original Supermarionation was a lot more sophisticated and elegant than this live action farce. (And that's saying it nicely.) - Kip Wells\nWhat is the sentiment of this review?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The sentiment of this review is negative. The reviewer expresses disappointment and frustration with the movie \"Thunderbirds\" and criticizes various aspects of the film, including the direction, screenplay, design, acting performances, and deviation from the original TV series.

He won the 1932 Olympic gold medal for 400-meter freestyle swimming event, which launched his career onto the silver screen. He starred in a number of popular films in the 1930s and 1940s. He also played the title role in the serials Tarzan the Fearless, Flash Gordon and Buck Rogers.\n\nIn some movies he is credited as \"Larry Crabbe\" or \"Larry (Buster) Crabbe\". Crabbe's role in the Tarzan serial, Tarzan the Fearless (1933), began a career in which he starred in more than a hundred movies. In King of the Jungle (1933), Jungle Man (1941), and the serial King of the Congo (1952), he played typical \"jungle man\" roles. He starred in several popular films at this time, including The Sweetheart of Sigma Chi alongside Betty Grable (1933) and Search for Beauty (1934).  In 1936 he was picked over several stars to play Flash Gordon in the very successful Flash Gordon serial, followed by two sequels, released by Universal in 1938 and 1940. The series was shown later extensively on American television in the 1950s and 1960s, then edited for release on home video. He also starred as Buck Rogers for Universal playing the role with dark hair unlike Flash Gordon's blonde hair. In 1939, Crabbe reunited with Betty Grable for a lead role in the mainstream comedy Million Dollar Legs.  Crabbe starred at the Billy Rose's Aquacade at the New York World's Fair in its second year of 1940, replacing a fellow Olympic swimmer and Tarzan actor Johnny Weissmuller.  During World War II Crabbe was contracted to Producers Releasing Corporation in lead roles from 1942-1946 where he portrayed a Western folk-hero version of Billy the Kid in 13 films and 23 as Billy Carson with his sidekick played by actor Al St. John. As a 34 year old married man, Crabbe had a deferment from the draft but made Army training films for the field artillery at Ft. Sill, Oklahoma along with Fuzzy St. John. Crabbe also played some jungle roles for the studio.  Following the war Crabbe appeared opposite Weissmuller as a rival in two jungle films, Swamp Fire (1946) and Captive Girl (1950). Crabbe returned to the jungle for his final serial playing the role of Thun'da in King of the Congo (1952).\n\nWhat else did Crabbe do in Hollywood in the 1930s?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "In addition to his roles as a \"jungle man\" and his iconic portrayals of Flash Gordon and Buck Rogers, Buster Crabbe had a successful career in Hollywood throughout the 1930s. He starred in a number of popular films during this time, including The Sweetheart of Sigma Chi (1933) alongside Betty Grable and Search for Beauty (1934). He also appeared in the film adaptation of the popular comic strip, Tarzan the Fearless (1933), which marked the beginning of his career as a leading man in Hollywood.\n\nCrabbe's success in the film industry was due in part to his athletic abilities. As a two-time Olympic swimmer, he was able to perform his own stunts in many of his films, which added to his appeal as an action hero. He was also known for his good looks and charming personality, which made him a popular leading man in romantic comedies and dramas.\n\nIn addition to his work in front of the camera, Crabbe was also involved in the production side of the film industry. He formed his own production company, Buster Crabbe Productions, in 1937 and produced several films under this banner. He also worked as a director and producer on a number of projects throughout his career.\n\nOverall, Buster Crabbe was a versatile and talented actor who made a significant impact on Hollywood in the 1930s and beyond. His athletic abilities, good looks, and charming personality made him a popular leading man, while his work behind the scenes demonstrated his creativity and entrepreneurial spirit."}]}

These seem to be the most important basic needs of the people we are trying to help. However, it's far from enough. Ladies and gentlemen, we've got to come up with some better ideas to help them. I was very surprised, then, when I read about a plan to make cheap laptop computers for children in developing countries. A man called Nicholas Negroponte invented a cheap laptop computer, which can run without electricity. He decided to invent this computer after he visited a school in Cambodia. The laptop which Mr. Negroponte has designed is a little different from the normal laptop computers you can buy in the shops. One difference is that it is covered in rubber so that it is very strong and won't be damaged easily. As an electricity supply can be a problem in developing countries, the computer also has a special handle so that children can wind the computer up to give it extra power when needed. These special laptop computers will cost less than 100 US dollars and Mr. Negroponte wants to build as many as 15 million machines in the first year of production. The idea is that these computers will help the children's education as they will be able to access the Internet. These computers might not help the people in developing countries immediately, but by improving children's education they should help people to find their own solutions to their problems in the long term. Another idea to help children in developing countries is to recycle old mobile phones so that they can be used again. In the UK, and, probably in many other countries too, millions of mobile phones are thrown away every year. The waste created by throwing away these old phones is very bad for the environment, so it seems to be an excellent idea to recycle them.

Movie title: The Magdalene Sisters Context: Set in Ireland, beginning in 1964, so-called \"fallen\" women were considered sinners who needed to be redeemed. The film follows the stories of four young women - Margaret (raped by her cousin), Bernadette (too beautiful and coquettish), Rose (an unmarried mother) and Crispina (an intellectually disabled unmarried mother) - who are all forced by their families or caretakers into the Magdalene Asylum. The film details the disastrous lives of the four girls whilst they are inmates of the laundries, portraying their harsh daily regimen, their squalid living conditions and the oppressive nature of the Catholic faith at the time. Each woman suffers unspeakable cruelty and violence from the Mother Superior, Sister Bridget, despite her gentle-faced appearance and outwardly soft-spoken demeanour. She is characterised as sadistic and almost inhuman at times, as conveyed through her merciless beating of Rose in full view of Bernadette, or when she mockingly laughs at Una as she hopelessly clutches at her fallen hair locks. The film also criticises the hypocrisy and corruption within the staff of the laundries. Sister Bridget relishes the money the business receives and it is suggested that little of it is distributed appropriately. Those who liken themselves to Mary Magdalene, who deprived herself of all pleasures of the flesh including food and drink, eat hearty breakfasts of buttered toast and bacon while the working women subsist on oatmeal. In one particularly humiliating scene, the women are forced to stand naked in a line after taking a communal shower. The nuns then hold a \"contest\" on who has the most pubic hair, biggest bottom, biggest breasts and smallest breasts. The corruption of the resident priest, Father Fitzroy, is made very clear through his sexual abuse of Crispina.

This is because of a phenomenon called perspective. Perspective is the way in which objects appear to the eye based on their distance from the viewer. When an object is far away, it appears smaller because the angle between the viewer and the object is smaller. This means that the object takes up less space in the viewer's field of vision, making it appear smaller.\n\nIn the example given in the text, the ship appears smaller as it moves further away from the viewer on the shore. This is because the ship is moving away from the viewer, increasing the distance between the viewer and the ship. As the distance between the viewer and the ship increases, the angle between them decreases, making the ship appear smaller.\n\nThis phenomenon is not limited to objects viewed from a distance. It can also be observed in everyday life. For example, when we hold a pencil close to our face, it appears larger than when we hold it at arm's length. This is because the angle between our eyes and the pencil is larger when it is close to our face, making it appear larger.\n\nIn conclusion, when we see something far away, it appears smaller due to the phenomenon of perspective.

The first occurrence of \"alleluia\" in this chapter is in verse 1, where it is used as an exclamation of praise and thanksgiving: \"After this I heard what seemed to be the loud voice of a great multitude in heaven, crying out, 'Alleluia! Salvation and glory and power belong to our God.'\"\n\nThe second and third occurrences of \"alleluia\" in chapter 19 are in verses 3 and 4, where they are repeated by the multitude in response to the announcement of the destruction of Babylon: \"Once more they cried out, 'Alleluia! The smoke from her goes up for ever and ever.' And the twenty-four elders and the four living creatures fell down and worshiped God who is seated on the throne, saying, 'Amen. Alleluia!'\"\n\nThe final occurrence of \"alleluia\" in the Book of Revelation is in verse 6, where it is used as a call to worship and praise: \"Then I heard what seemed to be the voice of a great multitude, like the sound of many waters and like the sound of mighty thunderpeals, crying out, 'Alleluia! For the Lord our God the Almighty reigns.'\"\n\nOverall, the four uses of \"alleluia\" in the Book of Revelation serve as expressions of joy, praise, and thanksgiving for God's ultimate victory over evil and the establishment of his kingdom."}]}

I look down the river, and the brightness of the approaching day blinds me. I see shapes moving behind me and beyond me, but who they are and what they do, I cannot say. I will tell what I know is true, and I will invent what I believe is true, and that, I think, is all you can ask any storyteller to do. I learned the Nix family history from the stories Pa told. Even at the age of four, I suspected that Pa's stories might not be perfectly true. When Pa said we Nixes came to North America as indentured servants working our way out of debtor's prison, Grandma Bette would make a face and say he couldn't know that. When he said we Nixes had Lakota and Ojibwe blood in our veins, Grandma Bette would say she wasn't prejudiced, but it simply wasn't so: she and Pa and his brothers and sisters were dark because her people were Black Dutch, from a part of Holland where everyone had black hair and black eyes.

Article: Some wonderfully creative uses of X-rays have been in the world of art.But the most impressive one is to uncover what has been covered up.Details unfolded by an X-ray of a painting can ' t be seen any other way.For example, in the past, paintings were often repaired if small pieces of paint fell off the canvas  . These repairs cannot be seen just by looking at the painting.It takes an X-ray to discover where the repairs have been made. An X-ray of a painting is one of the best ways to tell if it was created by a famous painter or if it is a forgery .If there is a question as to whether an old master has painted a certain painting or not, X-rays are made and compared to those of paintings that are known to be original.If the brushstrokes   , for example, are shown to be totally different than in other work done by a certain artist, then the painting is proved to be a fake copy. Since modern paints are usually made from different materials than paints of hundreds of years ago, the image they leave on an X-ray film looks different.This is another way X-rays can be used to spot a forgery.A modem artist will try to make a forgery look hundreds of years old by painting dirty varnish on it or by using artificial means to get the varnish to look cracked.To the naked eye the forgery may look old, but when a careful study of the X-ray image is made, the _ is obvious. It was common many years ago for an artist to finish a painting, decide it wasn't any good, and paint a completely different picture on top of it.Or artists would paint over others' work --it was their version of recycling.Taking an X-ray is the only way to find out if there is a picture underneath the picture you see with your eyes.Sometimes museums will be more interested in the painting beneath than the one on top, and will restore the older one by having the top layer painstakingly removed.

The negotiations between the robbers and the police are intense and gripping, keeping the audience on the edge of their seats. The addition of the fixer, Madeleine White, adds a layer of intrigue and mystery to the plot, as she tries to protect the contents of a safe deposit box within the bank.\n\nThe revelation that the bank's founder, Arthur Case, may have received money from the Nazis for unspecified services, resulting in the deaths of many Jewish people during World War II, adds a moral dilemma to the plot. The audience is left wondering whether the robbers are justified in their actions, given the potential crimes committed by the bank's founder.\n\nOverall, \"The Perfect Heist\" would be a fitting title for this movie, as it accurately describes the intricate planning and execution of the robbery, as well as the moral ambiguity surrounding the bank's founder. The movie would be a thrilling and thought-provoking watch for audiences who enjoy heist movies with a twist."}]}

When I got older and started going to school, we couldn't watch our game shows regularly. That was okay with me, though, because the one thing I liked better than watching game shows with my grandmother was helping her bake cakes. Watching her in the kitchen was amazing: she never seemed to need the recipes but everything she made tasted delicious. At first I would just sit in the kitchen and watch, even though I didn't understand what she was doing, As I got older, she let me help with the easy parts, such as measuring the sugar. The day she let me separate the eggs, I felt like I had found complete pleasure. At last, my parents decided that I could take care of myself, and my grandmother stopped coming over every day. The love of baking, however, stayed with me. I started baking by myself, and even if the cookies ended up burnt sometimes, more often they turned out pretty well.

In his realistic genre paintings he used mythological themes, making modern interpretations of classical subjects, with an emphasis on the female human body. During his life he enjoyed significant popularity in France and the United States, was given numerous official honors, and received top prices for his work. As the quintessential salon painter of his generation, he was reviled by the Impressionist avant-garde. By the early twentieth century, Bouguereau and his art fell out of favor with the public, due in part to changing tastes.

This unfinished work of Dante consists of four trattati , or `` books '' : a prefatory one , plus three books that each include a canzone ( long lyrical poem ) and a prose allegorical interpretation or commentary of the poem that goes off in multiple thematic directions . The Convivio is a major stage of development for Dante , very different from the visionary world of the Vita nuova ( although like the earlier work it too is a medium for the author 's evolving sense of artistic vocation and philosophical - spiritual quest ) . This difference is reflected in how the two works use the prosimetrum format : in the Vita Nova there is a complex interrelation and intertwining between the prose and the poetry , while in the Convivio large blocks of prose have an autonomous existence apart from the poems ; the content of the poetry is not amplified or edited in the prose so much as commented upon prosaically , to serve as points of departure for the various subjects that the Convivio discusses . Dante himself tells us that the prose of the Convivio is `` temperate and virile , '' in contrast to the `` fervid and passionate '' prose of the Vita Nova ; and that while the approach to this in the work of his youth was `` like dreaming '' the Convivio approaches it subjects soberly and wide awake , often modeling its style on Scholastic authors . The Convivio is a kind of vernacular encyclopedia of the knowledge of Dante 's time ; it touches on many areas of learning , not only philosophy but also politics , linguistics , science , and history . The treatise begins with the prefatory book , or proem , which explains why a book like the Convivio is needed and why Dante is writing it in the vernacular instead of Latin . It is one of Dante 's early defenses of the vernacular , expressed in greater detail in his ( slightly earlier ) linguistic treatise De vulgari eloquentia ( On Eloquence in the Vernacular ) . Books 2 and 3 form a...  - World literature is sometimes used to refer to the sum total of the worlds national literatures, but usually it refers to the circulation of works into the wider world beyond their country of origin. Often used in the past primarily for masterpieces of Western European literature, world literature today is increasingly seen in global context. Readers today have access to an unprecedented range of works from around the world in excellent translations, and since the mid-1990s a lively debate has grown up concerning both the aesthetic and the political values and limitations of an emphasis on global processes over national traditions.  - Italian (or \"lingua italiana\" ) is a Romance language. It is the second-closest to Latin in terms of vocabulary after Sardinian. Italian is an official language in Italy, Switzerland, San Marino, Vatican City and western Istria (in Slovenia and Croatia). It used to have official status in Albania, Malta and Monaco, where it is still widely spoken, as well as in former Italian East Africa and Italian North Africa regions where it plays a significant role in various sectors. Italian is spoken by small minorities in places such as France (especially in Corsica), Montenegro, Bosnia & Herzegovina, Crimea and Tunisia and by large expatriate communities in the Americas. Many speakers are native bilinguals of both standardized Italian and other regional languages. Italian is the fourth most studied language in the world.  - The Divine Comedy is a poem by Dante Alighieri, begun and completed 1320, a year before his death in 1321. It is widely considered the preeminent work of Italian literature, and is seen as one of the greatest works of world literature. The poem's imaginative vision of the afterlife is representative of the medieval world-view as it had developed in the Western Church by the 14th century. It helped establish the Tuscan language, in which it is written, as the standardized Italian language. It is divided into three parts: \"Inferno\", \"Purgatorio\", and \"Paradiso\".  - The Late Middle Ages or Late Medieval Period was the period of European history generally comprising the 14th and 15th centuries (c. 13011500). The Late Middle Ages followed the High Middle Ages and preceded the onset of the early modern era (and, in much of Europe, the Renaissance).  - Durante degli Alighieri, simply called Dante (, ; c. 1265  1321), was a major Italian poet of the Late Middle Ages.

Let's evaluate each option and determine which one is better for achieving this goal.\n\n1. Eyeshadow Primer: Using an eyeshadow primer is a popular solution for preventing eyeshadow from smudging or falling onto the cheek. Primers create a smooth base for the eyeshadow, helping it adhere better to the eyelids and reducing the chances of fallout. They also help to extend the longevity of the eyeshadow, keeping it in place for longer periods of time. Applying an eyeshadow primer before the actual eyeshadow can significantly minimize the risk of it ending up on the cheek.\n\n2. Setting Spray: Another option to prevent eyeshadow from falling on the cheek is to use a setting spray. Setting sprays are designed to lock makeup in place, creating a protective barrier that helps prevent smudging, creasing, and fallout. By spritzing a setting spray over the finished eyeshadow look, you can ensure that the eyeshadow stays in place throughout the day, reducing the chances of it transferring onto the cheek.\n\n3. Tapping off Excess Product: A simple technique that can be used to prevent eyeshadow fallout is to tap off any excess product from the eyeshadow brush before applying it to the eyelids. This helps to remove any loose or excess eyeshadow that may potentially fall onto the cheek. By tapping off the excess, you can control the amount of product being applied and minimize the risk of fallout.\n\n4. Using a Shield or Tissue: For those who struggle with eyeshadow fallout, using a shield or tissue can be an effective solution. Placing a small shield or tissue under the eye area while applying eyeshadow can catch any fallout, preventing it from landing on the cheek. This technique is particularly useful when working with dark or highly pigmented eyeshadows that are more prone to fallout.\n\nConsidering the options mentioned above, the most effective solution for preventing eyeshadow from falling on the cheek would be a combination of using an eyeshadow primer and tapping off excess product. By applying an eyeshadow primer as a base, you create a smooth surface for the eyeshadow to adhere to, reducing the chances of fallout. Additionally, tapping off any excess product from the brush before application helps to control the amount of eyeshadow being applied, minimizing the risk of it ending up on the cheek.\n\nWhile setting sprays and using a shield or tissue can also be helpful, they may not be as effective as the combination of an eyeshadow primer and tapping off excess product. Setting sprays can provide additional longevity to the eyeshadow, but they may not completely prevent fallout. Similarly, using a shield or tissue can catch fallout, but it may not address the root cause of the issue.\n\nIn conclusion, to prevent eyeshadow from falling on the cheek, using an eyeshadow primer as a base and tapping off excess product are the most effective solutions. These techniques work together to create a smooth and controlled application, reducing the risk of fallout and ensuring that your eyeshadow stays in place throughout the day."}]}

And when the junior team cheerleaders won a tournament last year, she was right there, dancing and cheering with the rest of the team. Not bad for someone whose legs were cut off below the knee when she was two years old. Brittany, 18, was born without shinbones --\"just blood and muscle tissue\", as she puts it. When she tried to walk, her legs twisted. After the operation, she adapted quickly. \"From day one, I basically jumped up and wanted to do everything,\" she says. Prosthetic legs  allowed her to move around upright, but too slowly to keep up with her friends. Brittany's solution: take the legs off and walk on her knees---sometimes she still does when safety and comfort permit. She's rarely _ . Other children laughed at her through the years, especially in junior high school, but she says the challenge only made her stronger. Now she's trying to convince her coaches to let her remove the prostheses and be a flyer, the cheerleader who's thrown in the air and caught by her teammates. Brittany doesn't think her problems are more difficult than the next person's. \"My disability was the first thing I had to get through, and that's going to prepare me for the future,\" she says. \"It's all just a test: If someone throws you a curve ball , what are you going to do?\"\nA:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "What was Brittany's dream in seventh grade?\nA) To be a dancer\nB) To be a cheerleader\nC) To be a gymnast\nD) To be a singer"}]}

These spores germinate and grow into hyphae, which are thread-like structures that form the basis of the mushroom's mycelium.

The three young girls live as sisters, but the more rambunctious Ivy is bored by their childish games of tea and rejoices at Ivan's unexpected early day return from the office, saying, \"There's going to be fireworks.\" Ivy's prediction soon comes true. Ivan catches Rebecca in bed with the handsome pool boy, and the two men scuffle. As Ivan tends to his wounds, he and Rebecca begin a loud argument about their adulterous affair. The shouting brings Catherine's attention from the garden. Upon learning of the affair, she immediately evicts Rebecca and her children. In 1996, Violet returns to the Greer home and is reunited with Joy for the first time in eleven years. Violet states that she is looking for a summer time residence while working as a waitress at Denny's Restaurants and planning to attend the local junior college. Joy suggests that she reside with them and stay in the late Catherine's room. Joy is an amateur tennis star and engaged to her boyfriend from Princeton University, Michael, who will be working as an intern for Joy's father's bank. During a late night party, Violet feels isolated and ridiculed by Joy's Ivy League friends, and excuses herself for late shift work. Afterward, Michael takes Joy to her room and initiates foreplay, only to be rejected. He accuses Joy of being sexually frigid, and insultingly says he understands her father's infidelity. As Michael is on his way out, he runs into Violet, who is dressed in a sadomasochistic costume, which causes him to question her employment at Denny's. Violet states that the two have gotten off on the wrong foot, and proceeds to perform oral sex on him. Violet's obsession with Joy motivates her to destroy all of her other relationships.

A whole field of cabbages, on the baron's land, are beheaded with a scythe. One of the Baron's sons disappears: he is found his feet and hands bound, his buttocks lashed by a whip.

Article: In the United States and several other countries, 2.5 million children play baseball in an organization called Little League. They play on teams in their hometowns. Their parents and other adults in the community coach or instruct them and serve as umpires to make sure that everyone follows the rules. Local businesses give money for the ball fields and the uniforms. Local teams compete against each other and the winners get to play teams that are more distant. Eventually, the top teams go to the Little League World Series. One hundred years after Abner Doubleday invented baseball in Cooperstown, New York, in 1839, Little League got started in Pennsylvania. Three men started the game for neighborhood boys with a smaller playing field and fewer innings than adult baseball. Little League became popular after World War II when the game spread across the United States. By 1955 it was played throughout North America and within five years it had spread to Europe. Children's baseball really caught on in Japan and Taiwan of China and teams from those areas won the World Series seven out of eight years. After this, the organization tried banning foreign teams from the World Series, but the ban came to an end after one year. At first, Little League was only for boys aged nine to twelve. However, in 1974, the parents of girl baseball players brought a law suit. The courts ruled that Little League had to include both boys and girls. Later Little League added on softball and other games for teenagers up to age eighteen. Occasionally a Little Leaguer becomes a professional player. For example, Gary Carter went from Little League to play nineteen seasons in the Major Leagues, ten of them as an All-Star player. But, by and large, youngsters play baseball for fun and because their parents are proud of them. Question: What is true about players today? Options: A: Little League is only for neighbourhood boys.

D: Children can only play until age twelve.\nA:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The correct answer to the question is option C: Girls and boys can participate to age eighteen.

Later, Little League added on softball and other games for teenagers up to age eighteen. Therefore, it is true that both girls and boys can participate in Little League up to the age of eighteen. Option A is incorrect because Little League is no longer only for neighborhood boys. Option B is incorrect because the article does not mention anything about girl players having to buy their suits.

Movement. \n\nThe two given facts suggest that earthquakes are caused by the movement of plates in the Earth's crust. Fault zones, which are areas where two plates meet, are constantly moving and colliding with each other. This movement creates stress on the rocks in the crust, which eventually leads to the rocks breaking and shifting suddenly, causing an earthquake. \n\nThe movement of plates in the Earth's crust is a result of the tectonic activity that occurs deep within the Earth. The Earth's crust is made up of several large plates that float on top of the molten mantle layer. These plates move slowly over time due to the convection currents in the mantle. When two plates meet, they can either move away from each other, towards each other, or slide past each other. It is the sliding past each other that creates the most stress on the rocks in the crust, leading to earthquakes. \n\nIn summary, the movement of plates in the Earth's crust causes earthquakes.

Loder was nominated for another MusicNL award the following year, this time in the Gospel Artist of the Year category; this nomination was, in part, due to Imperfections & Directions.In early 2012, Loder made a music video for \"Your Love Alone\", one of the album's tracks, which was uploaded to YouTube.

During a Fitzroy Football Club benefit concert with other Neighbours cast members, Minogue performed \"I Got You Babe\" as a duet with actor John Waters, and \"The Loco-Motion\" as an encore. She was subsequently signed to a recording contract with Mushroom Records in 1987. Her first single, \"The Locomotion\", spent seven weeks at number one on the Australian singles charts and became the country's highest-selling single in the 1980s. She received the ARIA Award for the year's highest-selling single. Its success resulted in Minogue travelling to England with Mushroom Records executive Gary Ashley to work with producers Stock, Aitken & Waterman. They knew little of Minogue and had forgotten that she was arriving; as a result, they wrote \"I Should Be So Lucky\" while she waited outside the studio. The song reached number one in the United Kingdom, Australia, Germany, Finland, Switzerland, Israel and Hong Kong. Minogue won her second consecutive ARIA Award for the year's highest-selling single, and received a \"Special Achievement Award\". Minogue's debut album, Kylie was released in July 1988. The album was a collection of dance-oriented pop tunes and spent more than a year on the UK Albums Chart, including several weeks at number one. The album went gold in the United States, and the single, \"The Locomotion\", reached number three on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart, and number one on the Canadian Singles Chart. The single \"Got to Be Certain\" became her third consecutive number one single on the Australian music charts. Later in the year, she left Neighbours to focus on her music career. Minogue also collaborated with Jason Donovan for the song \"Especially for You\", which peaked at number-one in the United Kingdom and in December 2014 sold its one millionth copy in the UK. Minogue was sometimes referred to as \"the Singing Budgie\" by her detractors over the coming years.

Mildred must bake and sell pies and cakes to support the family after Bert splits with his business partner, Wally Fay. Bert bitterly accuses Mildred of favoring their daughters, especially Veda, over him. Their quarrel intensifies after a phone call from Bert's mistress, Maggie Biederhof, and they decide to separate. Mildred retains custody of her two daughters, the 16-year-old Veda, a bratty social climber and aspiring pianist, and 10-year-old Kay, a tomboy. Mildred's principal goal is to provide material possessions for Veda, who longs for a social status above that of her family and is ashamed of her mother's work as a baker. When Mildred is forced to take a job as a waitress, she tries to hide the fact from Veda, but Veda learns the truth and treats her mother with derision. Mildred meets Monte Beragon, a Pasadena society playboy and heir whose inheritance is almost depleted. Beragon owns the building that Mildred wants to purchase for a restaurant, and he pursues a romantic interest in her.

While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Answer by taking a quote from the following article:\n\nJohn Aloysius Fahey (February 28, 1939 - February 22, 2001) was an American fingerstyle guitarist and composer who played the steel-string acoustic guitar as a solo instrument. His style has been greatly influential and has been described as the foundation of American Primitive Guitar, a term borrowed from painting and referring mainly to the self-taught nature of the music and its minimalist style. Fahey borrowed from the folk and blues traditions in American roots music, having compiled many forgotten early recordings in these genres. He would later incorporate classical, Portuguese, Brazilian, and Indian music into his oeuvre.\n\nWhile Fahey lived in Berkeley, Takoma Records was reborn. Fahey decided to track down blues legend Bukka White by sending a postcard to Aberdeen, Mississippi (White had sung that Aberdeen was his hometown, and Mississippi John Hurt had been rediscovered using a similar method). When White responded, Fahey and ED Denson, a friend from the Washington, D.C., area, who had also moved west, decided to travel to Memphis and record White. The recordings by White became the first non-Fahey Takoma release. Fahey also released a second album in late 1963, called Death Chants, Breakdowns and Military Waltzes. To their surprise the Fahey release sold better than White's and Fahey had a career going. His releases during the mid-1960s employed odd guitar tunings and sudden style shifts rooted firmly in the old-time and blues stylings of the 1920s. But he was not simply a copyist, as compositions such as \"When the Catfish Is in Bloom\" or \"Stomping Tonight on the Pennsylvania/Alabama Border\" demonstrate. Fahey described the latter piece as follows: \"The opening chords are from the last movement of Vaughan Williams' Sixth Symphony. It goes from there to a Skip James motif. Following that it moves to a Gregorian chant, \"Dies Irae\". It's the most scary one in the Episcopal hymn books, it's all about the day of judgment. Then it returns to the Vaughan Williams chords, followed by a blues run of undetermined origin, then back to Skip James and so forth.\" A hallmark of his classic releases was the inclusion of lengthy liner notes, parodying those found on blues releases.  In the later half of the sixties, Fahey continued to issue material through Takoma as well as Vanguard Records, which had signed him along with similar instrumental folk guitarists Sandy Bull and Peter Walker. Albums from this period, such as Days Have Gone By, The Voice of the Turtle, Requia, and The Yellow Princess, found Fahey making sound collages from such elements as Gamelan music, Tibetan chanting, animal and bird cries and singing bridges. In 1967, Fahey recorded with Texas psych-rock trio The Red Crayola at the 1967 Berkeley Folk Festival, music that resurfaced on the 1998 Drag City release The Red Krayola: Live 1967. The Red Crayola subsequently recorded an entire studio album with Fahey, but the Red Crayola's label demanded possession of the tapes and recorded documentation of those sessions has been missing ever since.  In addition to his own creative output, Fahey expanded the Takoma label, discovering fellow guitarists Leo Kottke, Robbie Basho, Bola Sete and Peter Lang, as well as emerging pianist George Winston. Kottke's debut release on the label, 6- and 12-String Guitar, ultimately proved to be the most successful of the crop, selling more than 500,000 copies. Other artists with albums on the label included Mike Bloomfield, Rick Ruskin, Rabindra Danks, the Fabulous Thunderbirds, Maria Muldaur, Michael Gulezian, and Canned Heat. In 1979, Fahey sold Takoma to Chrysalis Records. Jon Monday, who had been the general manager of the label since 1970, was the only employee to go with the new company. Chrysalis eventually sold the rights to the albums, and Takoma was in limbo until bought by Fantasy Records in 1995.\n\nWas he in any bands?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "John Fahey was not in any bands, but he did collaborate with Texas psych-rock trio The Red Crayola at the 1967 Berkeley Folk Festival and recorded music with them.

According to some accounts, Muhammad's wife Aisha was a highly educated woman who played an important role in transmitting the teachings of Islam to future generations. She is said to have been a skilled scholar and teacher who was respected by both men and women in the early Muslim community.\n\nOver time, other women in the Islamic world also began to pursue education and scholarship. One notable example is Fatima al-Fihri, a wealthy woman from Tunisia who founded the University of al-Qarawiyyin in Fez, Morocco in the 9th century. This institution is considered to be one of the oldest universities in the world and played an important role in the development of Islamic scholarship and education.\n\nOther influential figures in the history of female education in the Islamic world include Rabi'a al-Adawiyya, a mystic and poet who lived in the 8th century, and Zaynab al-Ghazali, an Egyptian activist and writer who founded the Muslim Women's Association in the mid-20th century.\n\nOverall, while Muhammad's wives certainly played a role in inspiring female education in the Islamic world, the creation of a pathway for women's education was a more complex process that involved a variety of factors and individuals over many centuries."}]}

The two bridges were constructed before the lake was filled, and replaced wooden structures. Site testing for both the Commonwealth Avenue and Kings Avenue bridges took place during late 1959 to early 1960. The construction of the Kings Avenue Bridge began in 1960, followed by Commonwealth Avenue Bridge the year after. Fortunately for the builders, Canberra was in a drought and the ground remained dry during construction. Both bridges use post-tensioned concrete, reinforced with rustproof steel cables.Both bridges are made of concrete and steel and are dual-carriageway; Commonwealth Avenue has three lanes in each direction while Kings Avenue has two. Instead of traditional lamp post lighting, Kings Avenue Bridge was illuminated by a series of fluorescent tubes on the handrails, a concept known as \"integral lighting\". The design was deemed a success, so it was introduced to the Commonwealth Avenue Bridge also. Both structures won awards from the Illumination Engineering Society.Kings Avenue Bridge opened on 10 March 1962. Prime Minister Menzies unlocked a ceremonial chain before the motorcade and pageant crossed the lake in front of a large crowd. Commonwealth Avenue Bridge opened in 1963 without an official ceremony.

Chaplin became a worldwide icon through his screen persona \"the Tramp\" and is considered one of the most important figures in the history of the film industry. His career spanned more than 75 years, from childhood in the Victorian era until a year before his death in 1977, and encompassed both adulation and controversy. Chaplin's childhood in London was one of poverty and hardship.\nContext: Between his time in the poor schools and his mother succumbing to mental illness, Chaplin began to perform on stage. He later recalled making his first amateur appearance at the age of five years, when he took over from Hannah one night in Aldershot. This was an isolated occurrence, but by the time he was nine Chaplin had, with his mother's encouragement, grown interested in performing. He later wrote: \"[she] imbued me with the feeling that I had some sort of talent\". Through his father's connections, Chaplin became a member of the Eight Lancashire Lads clog-dancing troupe, with whom he toured English music halls throughout 1899 and 1900. Chaplin worked hard, and the act was popular with audiences, but he was not satisfied with dancing and wished to form a comedy act.  In the years Chaplin was touring with the Eight Lancashire Lads, his mother ensured that he still attended school but, by age 13, he had abandoned education. He supported himself with a range of jobs, while nursing his ambition to become an actor. At 14, shortly after his mother's relapse, he registered with a theatrical agency in London's West End. The manager sensed potential in Chaplin, who was promptly given his first role as a newsboy in Harry Arthur Saintsbury's Jim, a Romance of Cockayne. It opened in July 1903, but the show was unsuccessful and closed after two weeks. Chaplin's comic performance, however, was singled out for praise in many of the reviews.  Saintsbury secured a role for Chaplin in Charles Frohman's production of Sherlock Holmes, where he played Billy the pageboy in three nationwide tours. His performance was so well received that he was called to London to play the role alongside William Gillette, the original Holmes. \"It was like tidings from heaven\", Chaplin recalled. At 16 years old, Chaplin starred in the play's West End production at the Duke of York's Theatre from October to December 1905. He completed one final tour of Sherlock Holmes in early 1906, before leaving the play after more than two-and-a-half years.\nQuestion: What was Charlie  Chaplin's first role?\n\nAnswer:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Charlie Chaplin's first role was as a newsboy in a play called \"Jim, a Romance of Cockayne\".

One night, Kane accidentally drops and breaks open one of the dolls, exposing a white dust (heroin) contained therein. As it turns out, Braden uses the doll gallery as a front for his drug-smuggling business. He tries to strike a deal with Caifano (Mario Gallo), a mob boss, but Caifano and Braden cannot find common ground and eventually engage in a turf war. Braden, as a silver \"demon\"-masked ninja, assassinates Caifano's informers and relatives to make him cower down. The police are confused about the killings, and local police martial arts trainer and expert, Dave Hatcher (Keith Vitali), is assigned to find a consultant. Dave persuades Cho to see his boss and Cho attests that only a ninja could commit these crimes, but refuses to aid the police any further.[1] In order to avoid payment for his 'merchandise', Caifano sends three men to rob the gallery.

The girls convince Larry Dubois (Marc McClure) to 'borrow' his Dad's Cadillac, and they take off for New York.

As the ship sets sail, a stowaway steals on to the boat and hides under the canvas cover of a life boat.The ship makes its way through the stormy south Indian Ocean. Wilson gathers the crew for a meeting to tell them where they're going, saying he couldn't risk telling them anything until they were far out of port. Wilson shows them a pair of photographs of an innocuous fog bank. One picture was taken in the 1940s by a US Navy vessel. The second was taken a few weeks prior to their departure from Surabaya. Wilson also shares another photo, this one taken by a US satellite that went off course and was armed with spectrographic instruments. The readings from the satellite, explained by Wilson's geologist, show that an island may exist behind the fog bank and that it may have petroleum deposits on it. Wilson is very excited, believing that, with the oil and gas shortage causing economic problems for Petrox back in the States, that the island will be a rich source of oil for the company.At that moment the meeting is interrupted by the same man who stowed away in the life boat. The stranger identifies himself as Jeff Prescott, a paleo-primatologist, who had snuck aboard the ship specifically because it was going to the island. He talks about the island's other secret: that a large beast inhabits the island, is the dominate life form there and is worshipped as a god by the local native tribe.

After releasing their eponymous debut album in 1992, the Wallflowers released what would become their best-known and highest-selling album, Bringing Down the Horse in 1996, which featured songs such as \"One Headlight\" and \"6th Avenue Heartache\". They went on to release an additional three albums before going on a seven-year hiatus, beginning in 2006.\n\nIn July 2004, the Wallflowers returned to the studio to record their fifth album, Rebel, Sweetheart. This time the band decided to record in Atlanta, Georgia, which is where their producer for this album, Brendan O'Brien, is based. O'Brien also contributed on guitar. Fred Eltringham joined the Wallflowers as their new drummer. Jakob Dylan wrote the songs, of which keyboardist Rami Jaffee has said: \"What I did notice is that kind of upbeat song with some pretty scary lyrics.\" Dylan painted the album's cover art himself.  On October 14, 2004, the Warren Zevon tribute album Enjoy Every Sandwich: The Songs of Warren Zevon was released, on which the Wallflowers covered Zevon's 1978 song \"Lawyers, Guns and Money.\" In promotion of the album, the Wallflowers performed \"Lawyers, Guns and Money\" on the Late Show with David Letterman with Zevon's son, Jordan, on October 12, 2004.  On October 31, 2004, the Wallflowers were flown via military transport plane to the USS John C. Stennis aircraft carrier in the middle of the Pacific Ocean to perform for the returning troops.  Rebel, Sweetheart was released on May 24, 2005, and was met with positive reviews. Despite widespread critical acclaim, Rebel, Sweetheart performed relatively poorly commercially, peaking at No. 40 on the Billboard 200. However, the first single from the album, \"The Beautiful Side of Somewhere\", hit No. 5 on AAA radio. The second single was \"God Says Nothing Back\". This was the first Wallflowers album to be released on DualDisc. On one side was the album, and on the other was a DVD that included exclusive performances and arrangements of some of the band's songs, as well as an interview with comedian Jon Lovitz. In promotion of the album, the Wallflowers did concerts for the Oxygen Custom Concert Series and PBS Soundstage. Around the time of the album's release, the band set out on what would be their last tour for two years. They were joined by Stuart Mathis on lead guitar. After 2005, the Wallflowers ended their relationship with Interscope Records.\n\nWhat did they try next"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "There is no information in the given article about what the Wallflowers tried next after ending their relationship with Interscope Records."}]}

Article: My daughter went to see The Wild One recently and she commented that Marlon Brando was wearing jeans so long ago. Of course he helped set the trend, so that got me thinking about the link between films and trends in fashion. Fashion and films have gone hand in hand for long. The Wild One is a good example: it appeared in 1954, starring Brando. Dressed in a black leather motorcycle jacket, leather cap and jeans, he created a look which is still considered \"cool\" today. Everyone from Madonna to middle-aged men is seen wearing the classic leather motorcycle jacket. Another strong influence on fashion trends was Breakfast at Tiffany's, starring Audrey Hepburn. She made famous the simple black dress that looks perfect at either a cocktail party or just standing around an expensive department store like Tiffany's with a pastry and coffee in your hand, as Audrey Hepburn does in the film. She looks so elegant, wearing simple but beautiful dresses, big dark glasses and a string of pearls around her neck. Audrey Hepburn still influences women's fashion with her \"Tiffany's look\". In more modern times, the film star Uma Thurman created a major fashion trend when she appeared in the film Pulp Fiction, made in 1994. Her style was very simple. Her black trousers, crisp white shirt and hair style was copied by women in the world. Influencing fashion trends can often be about timing. The movie Memoirs of a Geisha came just in time to start a trend in Japanese fashion. It started the Chinese actress Zhang Ziyi, who wore beautiful silk kimonos , and it won an Oscar for Costume Design. Many travel companies picked up on the trend and ran \"geisha trips\" to Japan. The film has also led to a regained interest in kimonos. It is now quite common to see young Japanese women wearing kimonos not just on traditional occasions, but at various social events. The fashion is also beginning to spread to western countries. Question: What does the film Memoirs of a Geisha lead to? Options: A: The popularity of the Chinese actress.

The group was created in 1988 by music producer Johnny Kitagawa, founder of Johnny & Associates, originally as a six-piece with Katsuyuki Mori, until his departure from the band in 1996. After making their debut in 1991, the group took the Japanese entertainment industry by storm, becoming the most successful boy band in Japanese history and the bestselling band in Asia, often referred to as a \"national treasure\" and a \"fortune and property of the country\" in Japan. SMAP was regarded as an iconic figure in Japan, after achieving an unprecedented level of success in numerous genres in the entertainment industry, including music, television, film, radio, and theater, as a group and individually.\n\nOn January 1, 1991, the band held their first concert in Nippon Budokan and their first tour from March through April, before releasing any music. On September 9, 1991, they released their first single, \"Can't Stop -Loving-\" from Victor Entertainment, which peaked at #2 on the charts. Subsequent singles, \"Seigi no Mikata wa Ate ni Naranai\", \"Kokoro no Kagami\", \"Makeru na Baby\" peaked in the top 10. The band asked the fans to write the lyrics for \"Kokoro no Kagami\", and the one submitted by a fourteen-year-old girl was chosen. The song was later used in a Panasonic television commercial. They were invited to perform the song at Kohaku Uta Gassen, an annual music show, on December 31, 1991.  At the same time of their debut, the Japanese music industry experienced what is frequently referred to as an \"Idol Ice Age\", where many of the popular music shows that aired weekly since the 1980s ended, and singers and bands lost a place to perform, resulting in scarce opportunities for TV exposure. Therefore, the agency decided to market the band through variety programs, where members participated in sketch comedies and game shows along with other television personalities. This non-mainstream marketing approach turned out to be a success, as the members' humorous and playful spirits on these shows propelled them to gain new fans, despite not having many musical performances on television since their debut.  In 1991, the band's first self-titled television show, SMAP no Gakuen Kids, got renewed and changed to, I Love SMAP, which aired until 1996. From October 7, 1991, Inagaki launched his radio program, Stop The SMAP, still airing as of 2016. From April 1992 to September 1995, the group appeared regularly on a weekly variety program, Yume ga Mori Mori. Due to the fact that this was the first time in Japanese history, that a band participated in a sketch comedy, this rare act attracted wide attention.  On January 1, 1992, they released their first album, SMAP 001, which peaked at #14 and released another album, SMAP 002, in the same year and peaked at #6. Their singles, \"Egao no Genki\", \"Yuki ga Futtekita\", \"Zutto Wasurenai\", \"Hajimete no Natsu\", \"Kimi wa Kimi dayo\", \"$10\", and \"Kimi iro Omoi\", released from 1992 through 1994, all peaked at the top 10. They headlined three tours in 1992, from January to August. In 1993, they released their third and fourth album, SMAP 003 and SMAP 004, which peaked at #11 and #3 respectively. In 1992, Inagaki starred in a drama television series, Hatachi no Yakusoku, as the main role. In 1993, Kimura starred in a drama television series, Asunaro Hakusho, which became a massive hit, with an average household share rating of 27% and 31.9% for the season finale.

They are tetrapods, but the snakes and a few species of lizard either have no limbs or their limbs are much reduced in size. Their bones are better ossified and their skeletons stronger than those of amphibians. The teeth are conical and mostly uniform in size. The surface cells of the epidermis are modified into horny scales which create a waterproof layer. Reptiles are unable to use their skin for respiration as do amphibians and have a more efficient respiratory system drawing air into their lungs by expanding their chest walls. The heart resembles that of the amphibian but there is a septum which more completely separates the oxygenated and deoxygenated bloodstreams. The reproductive system has evolved for internal fertilization, with a copulatory organ present in most species. The eggs are surrounded by amniotic membranes which prevents them from drying out and are laid on land, or develop internally in some species. The bladder is small as nitrogenous waste is excreted as uric acid.Turtles are notable for their protective shells. They have an inflexible trunk encased in a horny carapace above and a plastron below. These are formed from bony plates embedded in the dermis which are overlain by horny ones and are partially fused with the ribs and spine. The neck is long and flexible and the head and the legs can be drawn back inside the shell. Turtles are vegetarians and the typical reptile teeth have been replaced by sharp, horny plates. In aquatic species, the front legs are modified into flippers.Tuataras superficially resemble lizards but the lineages diverged in the Triassic period. There is one living species, Sphenodon punctatus. The skull has two openings (fenestrae) on either side and the jaw is rigidly attached to the skull. There is one row of teeth in the lower jaw and this fits between the two rows in the upper jaw when the animal chews. The teeth are merely projections of bony material from the jaw...

One afternoon, while driving through a quiet suburban   neighborhood I was so sad that I kept asking myself \"Why has my life become so hard?\" \"What's wrong with the world?\" Then I pulled over the bus to drop off a little girl and as she passed she handed me a pretty earring, saying she found it on the floor of the bus and I should keep it in case the owner came to look for it. In the evening, the owner did come to look for her earring. When I handed it to her, she got very excited and continued saying \"Thanks, you're a real gentleman.\" I told her that she should thank the little girl who had found it. She said, \"Yes, and you are a good driver, too. What a lovely world it is!\" Then she left with satisfaction. I was touched by her last words.

The researchers from California say the change is taking place in response to higher levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. The lowering of the waters' pH value is not great at the moment but could pose a serious threat to current marine life if it continues, they warn. Ken Caldeira and Michael Wickett, from the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, report their concerns in the journal Nature. Increasing use of fossil fuels means more carbon dioxide is going into the air, and most of it will eventually be absorbed by seawater. Once in the water, it reacts to form carbonic acid.  Scientists believe that the oceans have already become slightly more acidic over the last century. But these researchers have tried to predict what will happen in the future by combining what we know about the history of the oceans with computer models of climate change. \"This level of acidity will get much more extreme in the future if we continue releasing CO2 into the atmosphere,\" said Dr Caldeira. \"And we predict amounts of future acidity will exceed anything we have seen over the last several hundred million years, let alone perhaps after rare catastrophic events such as asteroid impacts .\" If carbon dioxide release continues unabated , ocean pH could be reduced by as much as 0.77 units, the authors warn. It is not  ly clear what that means for marine life, however. Most organisms live near the surface, where the greatest pH change would be expected to occur, but deep-ocean lifeforms may be more sensitive to pH changes. Coral reefs and other organisms whose skeletons or shells contain calcium carbonate may be particularly affected, the team speculate. They could find it much more difficult to build these structures in water with a lower pH. In recent years some people have suggested deliberately storing carbon dioxide from power stations in the deep ocean as a way of curbing global warming.

Question: What is the word we don't use most in today's society Context: The terms 'federalism' and 'confederalism' both have a root in the Latin word foedus, meaning treaty, pact or covenant. Their common meaning until the late eighteenth century was a simple league or inter-governmental relationship among sovereign states based upon a treaty. They were therefore initially synonyms.

In the course of the nineteenth century the meaning of federalism would come to shift, strengthening to refer uniquely to the novel compound political form, while the meaning of confederalism would remain at a league of states.

She runs into her mysterious ex-boyfriend El Wray (Freddy Rodriguez) at the Bone Shack, a BBQ restaurant owned by J.T. Hague (Jeff Fahey) and his sheriff brother (Michael Biehn). Meanwhile, a group of officials at a nearby US military base, led by the demented Lt. Muldoon (Bruce Willis), are making a business transaction with a chemical engineer named Abby (Naveen Andrews) for mass quantities of a deadly biochemical agent known as DC2 (codename \"Project Terror\"). When Muldoon learns that Abby has an extra supply on hand, he attempts to take Abby hostage, and Abby intentionally releases the gas into the air. The gas reaches the town and turns most of its residents into deformed bloodthirsty psychopaths, referred to as \"sickos\" by the surviving humans. The infected townspeople are treated by the sinister Dr. William Block (Josh Brolin) and his unhappy, unfaithful bisexual anesthesiologist wife Dakota (Marley Shelton) at a local hospital. Random zombie attacks begin along the highway, causing El Wray, with Cherry as his passenger, to crash his truck. In the aftermath, several zombies tear off Cherry's right leg. Also falling victim, fatally, is Tammy (Stacy \"Fergie\" Ferguson), who was on her way to into town to reunite with her former lover Dakota. When Tammy's body arrives at the hospital, Dr. Block recognizes her and by comparing text messages on the cellular phones of Tammy and his wife, realizes Dakota was about to leave him. He then attacks Dakota with her own anesthetic syringe needles, stabbing her repeatedly in the hands, rendering them useless, before locking her in a closet to tend to other patients, including Cherry, who is still alive.

It's night, and all the houses look exactly the same, with desert and nothingness not far from this quaint little slice of suburbia.Inside one of the homes, a small dog climbs through the pet door of the back door and walks past a big screen TV with the local news describing the latest in a bizarre string of attacks, where people say someone is trying to bite them in parking lots and other odd places. The television also plays an advertisement for Peter Vincent's \"Fright Night\", which is a Las Vegas vampire-themed illusion show at the Hard Rock Hotel that's a mix of David Copperfield, Chris Angel, and Vincent Price.Inside the house, the dog senses something's wrong as the camera shows a boy being tossed out of a room like a rag doll... a woman inside the room clearly being eaten by something with nasty, grayish claws and very long nails. The boy regains enough of his senses to head upstairs, trying to hide from the creature. In a bedroom, the parents of the house are both dead, the mother on the bed exsanguinated and the father on the floor with his neck slashed open while he was trying to unlock and load up a rifle. The boy dives under the bed and tries fumbling with the gun himself, snagging the key to the lock from the dead man's pants. As he's fumbling, the creature comes into the room and starts to drag the man's body away. He hears the boy drop the bullets for the gun, lifts up the bed, and kills him.The next day, we are introduced to Charley Brewster (Anton Yelchin), a classic, all-American teen, with a motor bike he's trying to fix up and an inexplicably hot girlfriend named Amy (Imogen Poots) who tools around in a lime green Volkswagon Beetle. Charley is a recovering dork, who until recently was more interested in making Power Rangers-style YouTube videos with his friends Ed and Adam than girls... but all that seems to have changed with Amy.

The Broncos grabbed the early lead, with cornerback Aqib Talib returning an interception off Bengals' cornerback Andy Dalton 33 yards for a touchdown. However, on the first play of the Bengals' third possession, running back Jeremy Hill reeled off an 85-yard touchdown run to tie the score. The Bengals claimed the lead in the second quarter, with a 37-yard field goal by placekicker Mike Nugent. On the Broncos' next possession, quarterback Peyton Manning was intercepted by Bengals' safety Reggie Nelson, and the Bengals capitalized, with Dalton connecting on a 2-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Jermaine Gresham. A 49-yard field goal by Nugent with one minute remaining in the first half increased the Bengals' lead to 20-7. The Broncos had one last possession before halftime, however, placekicker Connor Barth missed on a 49-yard field goal attempt. On the Broncos' initial possession of the second half, return specialist Omar Bolden returned the opening kickoff to the Bengals' 21-yard line. Four plays later, running back C. J. Anderson scored on a 1-yard touchdown run. However, the Bengals had a response, as Adam Jones advanced the ensuing kickoff to the Broncos' 27-yard line. Three plays later, Dalton threw a 22-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Giovani Bernard. The Broncos then scored 14 unanswered points, with Manning throwing a pair of touchdown passes to wide receiver Emmanuel Sanders &#8212; from 4 and 5 yards out &#8212; to give the Broncos a 28-27 lead. The second scoring play came after Broncos' linebacker Von Miller forced a fumble off Hill just as the Bengals were attempting to add to their lead. Rain started to fall in the fourth quarter, and on the Broncos' first fourth quarter possession, Manning was intercepted by Jones deep in Broncos' territory, however, a 15-yard taunting penalty on Nelson pushed the Bengals out of field goal range. The Broncos were forced to punt on their next possession, and return specialist Brandon Tate advanced all the way to the Broncos' 9-yard line. The Broncos defense forced the Bengals to settle for a 23-yard field goal by Nugent to give the Bengals a 30-28 lead with 7:53 remaining in the game. The two teams traded punts on their next possessions, and the Broncos attempted a rally, however, Bengals' cornerback Dre Kirkpatrick returned an interception off Manning 30 yards for a touchdown. With the rain intensifying, the Broncos had one last possession, but Manning threw another interception to Kirkpatrick, this one deep in Bengals' territory &#8212; Manning's fourth interception of the game &#8212; to seal the victory for the Bengals.

But it is unlikely any past president would envy the legal challenges facing Trump, from the Russia investigation to Stormy Daniels to the scrutiny law enforcement is giving his personal lawyer, Michael Cohen. On Tuesday it was a night of pomp and glamor at the White House as President Donald Trump and Mrs. Trump welcomed French President Macron and his wife for a state dinner. The two presidents got along famously during their White House meetings. The only damper on the day came when both men were in the Oval Office and a reporter asked Trump about the legal difficulties facing his longtime personal attorney, Michael Cohen. \"Mr. President, what about Michael Cohen? Are you considering a pardon for Michael Cohen?\" asked ABC correspondent Jonathan Karl. After a pause, the president responded. \"Stupid question,\" he said dismissively. Cohen is under scrutiny for a payment to an adult film star. Stormy Daniels says it was hush money to keep her quiet about a brief affair she had with Trump in 2006, a claim the president has denied. Trump has frequently complained about the recent FBI raids on Cohen's home and office and the ongoing Russia probe led by special counsel Robert Mueller. Earlier this month Trump spoke up during a meeting with military officials at the White House. \"Here we are talking about Syria, we are talking about a lot of serious things with the greatest fighting force ever, and I have this witch hunt constantly going on for over 12 months now.\" Several legal analysts have said the increased scrutiny of Trump's long relationship with Cohen could become a serious problem for the president. \"There has been no suggestions that Cohen has nothing that he could say, which suggests that they know that Cohen actually does possess information that could be damaging to Trump or the Trump organization more generally as a legal matter,\" said George Washington University Law...

A low, flat coffee table squatted below the glowing displays, supporting three keyboards, a bank of video editing tools and four different phone carriages.

More cars are produced every year and the streets are getting more and more crowded. So during \"rush hours\", when people are going to or from their work, traffic is brought to a standstill. It has been suggested that commuters--the people who travel to work every day from outside the city--should share their cars and give each other lifts. So each car would carry four or five people instead of only one. It is an excellent idea., however, so far nobody has been able to think of a way to make people do so. To discourage motorists from leaving their cars in the streets all day, parking meters  are used. When you park at a meter, you must put a coin in the slot . This pays for a certain amount of time. The meter records this and it shows when the time that you have paid for is finished. If the car is still there then, you have to pay a fine. Traffic wardens  look after the meters. They walk around the streets and check that every meter shows that money has been paid for the car parked there. If a meter shows 'TIME EXPIRED', the motorist who has left his car there is fined. Of course, the traffic warden can not wait for the owner of the car to return. He carries many printed forms, and on one of these he writes down all the details, such as the number of the car, where it is parked, how much the driver must pay and where he must send the money. He leaves this form on the car, where the driver will be able to see it easily; he usually pushes it under one of the windscreen wipers  so that it will not be blown away. And in case it rains before the motorist returns, the form is put in a little plastic envelope to protect it. When the driver comes back, he gets an unpleasant surprise, but it is his own fault for leaving his car too long at parking meter. Question: In order to reduce traffic commuters_, Answer:\n\nAvailable choices:\n[A]. should go to work every other day.\n[B]. should go by bus.\n[C]. had better share one's car and ask for lifts.\n[D]. shouldn't go to work by car.\nAnswer:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The answer is: [C]. had better share one's car and ask for lifts."}]}

He tied his horse in front of the saloon, unwinding his long body as if a sudden movement might snap it.

They are trying to develop an environmentally friendly refrigerator that runs without electricity. We all know that modern fridges cause damage to the environment. They work by using a kind of man-made greenhouse gas called Freon  , which is far more damaging than carbon dioxide. Now Malcolm McCulloch, an electrical engineer at Oxford, is leading a three-year project to develop appliances that can be used in places without electricity. His team has completed a prototype   of a fridge patented in 1930 by Einstein. It used only pressurized gases to keep things cold. The design was partly used in the first refrigerators, but the technology was dropped when more efficient compressors   became popular in the 1950s. That meant a switch to using Freon. Einstein's idea uses butane   and water and takes advantage of the fact that liquids boil at lower temperatures, when the air pressure around them is lower. \"If you go to the top of Mount Qomolangma, water boils at a much lower temperature than it does when you're at sea level and that's because the pressure is much lower up there,\" said McCulloch.At one side is the evaporator  , a bottle that contains liquid butane. \"If you introduce a new vapor above the butane, the liquid boiling temperature decreases and, as it boils off, it takes energy from the surroundings to do so,\" says McCulloch. \"That's what makes it cold.\" The gas fridges based on Einstein's design were replaced by Freon-compressor fridges partly because Einstein's design was not very efficient. But McCulloch thinks that by changing the design and replacing the types of gases used it will be possible to quadruple   the efficiency. However, McCulloch's fridge is still in its early stages. \"It's very much a prototype,\" he said. \"Give us another month and we'll have it working.\"\nThe answer is:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "What is the main goal of the project led by Malcolm McCulloch at Oxford University?\nA) To rebuild an early invention by Albert Einstein\nB) To develop a more efficient compressor for modern fridges\nC) To develop an environmentally friendly refrigerator that runs without electricity\nD) To replace Freon with a different man-made greenhouse gas"}]}

This energy is what powers the Sun and allows it to emit light and heat that reaches the Earth.\n\nIf there is less heat entering the atmosphere, it means that there is less energy being generated by the Sun's fusion reactions. This, in turn, means that there will be less light and heat being emitted by the Sun, resulting in less sunlight arriving at the Earth. Therefore, the answer to the question is option B: less.\n\nThe amount of sunlight that reaches the Earth is crucial for the survival of all living organisms on the planet.

The choice of metal is important because not all metals can be magnetized. Only ferromagnetic materials such as iron, nickel, and cobalt can be magnetized. Therefore, the first step in the process should be to ensure that the metal being used is ferromagnetic.\n\nOnce a suitable piece of metal has been selected, the next step is to wrap the conductive copper wire around it. The wire should be wrapped tightly and evenly around the metal to ensure that the electric current flows smoothly through it.\n\nThe third step is to introduce an electric current from a power source. The current should be strong enough to create a magnetic field in the wire but not so strong that it damages the wire or the metal.\n\nAs the electric current flows through the wire, a magnetic field is created in the wire. This magnetic field then interacts with the metal, causing it to become magnetized.\n\nFinally, when the power source is turned off, the magnetic field in the wire dissipates, and the metal is no longer magnetized.\n\nIn summary, the missing first step in the process of magnetizing a piece of metal is to select a suitable ferromagnetic material.

A great example of Nile's new direction would be the song \"Unas Slayer of the Gods\" this is a 12 minute epic song. Compare this to the 2 minute songs on Amongst the Catacomb of Nephren-Ka and you'll see how much Nile has changed. Not to say, Catacombs is a bad CD, that is actually my favorite Nile CD, just because it is just so all out brutal.

Pollination is the process by which pollen from the male reproductive organ of a flower (anther) is transferred to the female reproductive organ (stigma) of the same or a different flower. Once the pollen reaches the stigma, it germinates and grows a tube that penetrates the style and reaches the ovary. The sperm cells inside the pollen tube then fertilize the egg cells inside the ovules, resulting in the formation of zygotes. These zygotes develop into embryos inside seeds, which eventually grow into the next sporophyte generation. Therefore, without pollination, fertilization cannot occur, and the plant cannot reproduce."}]}

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Please answer the following question: Information:  - \"Searchin'\" is a song written by Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller specifically for The Coasters. It was released as a single on Atco Records in March 1957, and topped the Rhythm and Blues Chart for twelve weeks. It reached #3 on the national pop singles chart.  - Doo-wop is a genre of music that was developed in African-Americans communities of New York City, Philadelphia, Chicago, Baltimore, Newark, Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, Detroit, Washington, D.C. and Los Angeles in the 1940s, achieving mainstream popularity in the 1950s and early 1960s. Built upon vocal harmony, doo-wop was one of the most mainstream, pop-oriented R&B styles of the time. Singer Bill Kenny (19141978) is often called the \"Godfather of Doo-wop\" for his introducing the \"top and bottom\" format which featured a high tenor singing the lead and a bass singer reciting the lyrics in the middle of the song. Doo-wop features vocal group harmony, nonsense syllables, a simple beat, sometimes little or no instrumentation, and simple music and lyrics.  - `` Along Came Jones '' is a comedic song written by Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller and originally recorded by The Coasters , but covered by many other groups and individuals .  - A composer (Latin \"compn\"; literally \"one who puts together\") is a person who creates or writes music, which can be vocal music (for a singer or choir), instrumental music (e.g., for solo piano, string quartet, wind quintet or orchestra) or music which combines both instruments and voices (e.g., opera or art song, which is a singer accompanied by a pianist). The core meaning of the term refers to individuals who have contributed to the tradition of Western classical music through creation of works expressed in written musical notation (e.g., sheet music scores).  - Rhythm and blues, often abbreviated as R&B or RnB, is a genre of popular African-American music that originated in the 1940s. The term was originally used by record companies to describe recordings marketed predominantly to urban African Americans, at a time when \"urbane, rocking, jazz based music with a heavy, insistent beat\" was becoming more popular. In the commercial rhythm and blues music typical of the 1950s through the 1970s, the bands usually consisted of piano, one or two guitars, bass, drums, saxophone, and sometimes background vocalists. R&B lyrical themes often encapsulate the African-American experience of pain and the quest for freedom and joy. Lyrics focus heavily on the themes of triumphs and failures in terms of relationships, freedom, economics, aspirations, and sex.  - The Drifters are a long-lasting American doo-wop and R&B/soul vocal group. They were originally formed to serve as a backing group for Clyde McPhatter (of Billy Ward and his Dominoes) in 1953.  - The Coasters are an American rhythm and blues/rock and roll vocal group who had a string of hits in the late 1950s. Beginning with \"Searchin'\" and \"Young Blood\", their most memorable songs were written by the songwriting and producing team of Leiber and Stoller. Although the Coasters originated outside of mainstream doo-wop, their records were so frequently imitated that they became an important part of the doo-wop legacy through the 1960s.  - Lyricist Jerome \"Jerry\" Leiber (April 25, 1933  August 22, 2011) and composer Mike Stoller (born March 13, 1933) were American songwriting and record producing partners. They found initial successes as the writers of such crossover hit songs as \"Hound Dog\" (1952) and \"Kansas City\" (1952). Later in the 1950s, particularly through their work with The Coasters, they created a string of ground-breaking hitsincluding \"Young Blood\" (1957), \"Searchin'\" (1957), and \"Yakety Yak\" (1958)that used the humorous vernacular of teenagers sung in a style that was openly theatrical rather than personal. They were the first to surround black music with elaborate production values, enhancing its emotional power with The Drifters in \"There Goes My Baby\" (1958), which influenced Phil Spector, who studied their productions while playing guitar on their sessions.  - \"Yakety Yak\" is a song written, produced, and arranged by Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller for The Coasters and released on Atlantic Records in 1958, spending seven weeks as #1 on the R&B charts and a week as number one on the Top 100 pop list. This song was one of a string of singles released by The Coasters between 1957 and 1959 that dominated the charts, one of the biggest performing acts of the rock and roll era.  - Phillip Harvey \"Phil\" Spector (born Harvey Phillip Spector; December 26, 1939) is an American record producer, musician, songwriter, and businessman who developed the Wall of Sound, a music production formula he described as a \"Wagnerian\" approach to rock and roll. Spector is considered the first auteur among musical artists for acting not only as a producer, but also the creative director, writing or choosing the material, and masterminding all phases of the recording process. He is acknowledged as one of the most influential figures in pop music history.

Movie title: Goodbye, Mr. Chips Movie plot: In 1920s Britain, Arthur Chipping is an established member of the teaching staff at the Brookfield School. He is a stodgy teacher of Latin, disliked by his pupils, who call him Mr. Chips. Chips meets Katherine Bridges, a music hall soubrette, in the dining room of the Savoy Hotel in London on the eve of his summer holiday. Dissatisfied with her career and depressed by her romantic entanglements, she sets sail on a Mediterranean cruise and is reunited with Chips by chance in Pompeii. Seeing in him a lonely soul similar to herself, she arranges an evening at the theatre after they return to Britain, and the two find themselves drawn to each other. When Chips arrives at Brookfield for the autumn term, it is with his new wife on his arm, much to the shock of the staff and delight of the pupils, who find Mrs Chips' charm to be irresistible. Although her close friend and confidante Ursula Mossbank helps Katherine thwart Lord Sutterwick's plan to deprive the school of a generous financial endowment because of the woman's background, her past eventually deprives Chips of his longheld dream of being named headmaster in 1939. Still, the couple's devotion to each other overcomes all obstacles threatening their marriage, extending through 20 years together, when Katherine is killed in 1944 by a German V-1 flying bomb while entertaining the troops at a local Royal Air Force base. Too late for his wife to share in his happiness, Chips was picked as headmaster of Brookfield that same day, and lives out his years at the school, loved by his pupils and comforted by his happy memories.\nAnswer:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Kathy is on a Mediterranean cruise."}]}

Bearded dragons are active during the day and do not mind people holding them. Geckos are another popular pet lizard. They are a little more difficult to care for. Geckos are active at night and need a warm place to live.Like bearded dragons,they can be held by their owners.Both of these lizards can live ten years or more when they are well cared for. Two lizards that are bad choices for pets are iguanas and chameleons. Iguanas can grow to be almost two meters(nearly six feet),so they need a big space to live in.They can also bite or scratch   their owners.Chameleons do not hurt their owners,but they are quite difficu1t to care for.

Inside is Ripley (Sigourney Weaver), the only survivor from the previous film, having escaped in the shuttle of the cargo ship Nostromo, which she blew up after an aggressive and hostile alien species was responsible for killing her colleagues. Ripley is still in cryogenic sleep with Jones, the crew's pet cat, lying on top of her. A proximity alert goes off: the lifeboat is intercepted by a salvage vessel. The crew uses a welding torch to open the door and enters, finding that Ripley is still alive.In Gateway Station, a space facility orbiting Earth, Ripley regains consciousness in a hospital. A nurse tells her she is in a medical bay. She is visited by Carter Burke (Paul Reiser), a representative of Weyland-Yutani (the \"Company\" from the previous film, and Ripley's employer) who brings Jones the cat along. When Ripley states that she does not recognize the medical bay, Burke gives her some terrible news: she has been in hypersleep for 57 years, her ship having drifted aimlessly through space until the salvage vessel discovered it by very fortunate coincidence. Ripley shows clear distress and discomfort, when Jones starts hissing at her as she starts to convulse in the bed. Burke calls for medical attention, and the staff try to restrain Ripley. She pleads with them to kill her, before pulling her shirt up to reveal something pushing out of her stomach. Ripley suddenly wakes up bolt-upright in the hospital bed, clutching her chest, revealing the scene to be a nightmare. A nurse on the monitor next to her bed asks her if she needs something to help her sleep, but Ripley declines. The nurse was the one featured in her dream; the dream was a recollection from a real encounter with Burke, apart from the alien bursting out.Some time later, Ripley is sitting in an simulated environment waiting for Burke, who wants to prepare her for a board hearing.

The Nobel Prize in Literature 2012 is awarded to Chinese writer Mo Yan \"who with hallucinatory realism merges folk tales, history and the contemporary,\" said Englund at a press conference. Mo Yan, a pseudonym for Guan Moye, was born in 1955 and grew up in Gaomi in Shandong province in eastern China.His parents were farmers.

The book consists of five stories that unfold and interweave in Gaomi in several turbulent decades in the 20th century, with depictions of bandit culture, the Japanese occupation and the harsh conditions endured by poor farm workers, according to the biography.Red Sorghum was successfully filmed in 1987, directed by famous Chinese director Zhang Yimou. Through a mixture of fantasy and reality, historical and social perspectives, Mo Yan has created a world reminiscent in its complexity of those in the writings of William Faulkner and Gabriel Garcia Marquez, at the same time finding a departure point in old Chinese literature and in oral tradition, the academy commented in the biographical statement. In addition to his novels, Mo Yan has published many short stories and essays on various topics.In spite of his social criticism, he is seen in his homeland as one of the foremost contemporary authors, the statement added.

Article: How do you feel about watching other people work?          Nothing is more refreshing on a warm summer day than watching someone else work. Right now,I'm sitting on my porch and watching young Beth baling  the big field on top of the hill.She's been haying that field for over ten years.I know:I put her on the tractor when she was just twelve years old. She picked a great day for baling.It's not too hot,and there's a nice breeze.On Monday,when she cut the field,it was so hot I thought the corn would start popping in the field.Didn't stop her,though.She just stuck that big hat on her head,wrapped a wet handkerchief around her neck,and set to work.I remember when I would have done the same thing.

By the time Etty exhibited Musidora, the theme was becoming something of a cliche, such that by 1850 it was described by The Literary Gazette as \"a favourite subject for a dip of the brush\". As interest in studies of Musidora waned, its role as a pretext for nude paintings by English artists was replaced by Lady Godiva, who had become a topic of increased interest owing to Alfred, Lord Tennyson's poem Godiva. After the death of William Wordsworth in 1850, James Thomson ceased to be a major influence on writers. From the 1870s his popularity with readers waned, and by the end of the 20th century his works other than Rule, Britannia! were little known.When Etty died in 1849, despite having worked and exhibited until his death, he was still  regarded by many as a pornographer. Charles Robert Leslie observed shortly after Etty's death that \"[Etty] himself, thinking and meaning no evil, was not aware of the manner in which his works were regarded by grosser minds\". Interest in him declined as new movements came to characterise painting in Britain, and by the end of the 19th century the value of his paintings had fallen. It is likely that the composition and style of John Everett Millais's controversial The Knight Errant was influenced by Musidora, but other than Millais, and Etty's admirer and imitator William Edward Frost, few other artists were directly influenced by Etty's work. In 1882 Vanity Fair commented on Musidora that \"I know only too well how the rough and his female companion behave in front of pictures such as Etty's bather. I have seen the gangs of workmen strolling round, and I know that their artistic interest in studies of the nude is emphatically embarrassing.\" By the early 20th century Victorian styles of art and literature fell dramatically out of fashion in Britain, and by 1915 the word \"Victorian\" had become a derogatory term. Frederick Mentone's The Human Form in Art (1944) was one of the few 20th-century academic works to favourably view Musidora.\nAnswer:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The name of the person who was regarded as a pornographer was Etty."}]}

Simply write a \"4\" outside the division bar with a \"3\" on the inside. The \"4\" is your divisor, and the \"3\" is your dividend. Since you're working with a fraction, you know that your answer will be less than one, so this first step is necessary. After you do this, you'll need to place a decimal after the 3 under the division bracket and write an additional zero after it. Though 3 and \"3.0\" are the same, adding the extra zero will allow you to divide 4 into the 3.0. .

Here is how you do it:  First, divide \"4\" into 3.0, which you can think of as 30. The closest you can get is 4 x 7, or 28, which will give you a remainder of 2. So, write a 7 after the \"0.\" above the division bracket and \"28\" below the \"3.0\" under the division bracket. Under that, write 2, your remainder, or what you have left when you subtract 28 from 30. Next, add another \"0\" to the \"3.0\" so you have \"3.00\", or what you can think of as \"300,\" under the division bracket.

Write the \"5\" to the right of the \"0.7\" above the division bracket, so you have \"0.75\" written there. You'll find that \"3\" divided by \"4\" will give you \".75\".

Coached by veteran trainer Frank Couzo, the team prepares to meet an unstoppable group of true martial arts experts. Their chances of winning are virtually non-existent, as the Koreans train all year long and are known as the best the sport has to offer. Along their journey, the Americans have to deal with their personal conflicts and tragedies, before they become a team. When the tournament starts, Virgil and Sonny are out classed by their Korean opponents. Travis does his best to psyche up the team with his brash attitude leading to a sudden death breaking duel with his opponent. Couzo invites Alex's family to motivate him to win; however, his shoulder is severely re-injured during his bout. Instead of giving up, he implores Tommy to \"pop\" the shoulder back into place and resumes the fight with one arm, ultimately defeating his opponent. Finally, Tommy faces the captain of the Korean team, Dae Han, the man responsible for the death of his brother. After a slow start, Tommy gets the upper hand and delivers a series of moves that forces Dae Han solely on the defensive. As the match nears its end, Tommy has brought the American team within a single point of victory. Consumed with vengeance, Tommy prepares to end the fight, but realizing that the battered Dae Han would likely not survive the attack, Couzo orders Tommy to stand down, saving the man's life but forfeiting the victory as time expires.

The disadvantage of asexual reproduction is that organisms do not receive a mix of traits from both parents. An organism that is born through asexual reproduction only has the DNA from the one parent. In fact, the offspring is genetically an exact copy of the parent. This can cause problems for the individual. For example, if the parent has a gene that causes a particular disease, the offspring will also have the gene that causes that disease. Organisms produced sexually may or may not inherit the disease gene because they receive a mix of their parents' genes.  Now, I have a new situation: A species of animal called a markalong was discovered that can reproduce either sexually or asexually. Two markalongs were just born from different families in a zoo. The first markalong, animal A, has only one parent. The second markalong, animal B, has two parents.

On the other hand, animal B has two parents, which means it was produced through sexual reproduction. Therefore, animal A is the markalong that was produced asexually."}]}

that's socialising with colleagues.\nIt is instead a business meeting, usually in a restaurant, and typically with someone from another organisation, or at least someone who doesn't work in your team.\nAnd the conversation will include business matters - be it talk about a sale, agreement or understanding that benefits both parties.\nYou might think that going for a business lunch is a simple thing, but it is in fact beset with a whole menu of potential perils and pratfalls.\nFrom the choice of venue, to what food you pick, whether you order alcohol, and how you share the bill, any number of things can go wrong.\nTalking politics and religion is almost always a complete no-no, but what if an innocent chat about current affairs quickly turns to President Trump, Brexit or Scottish independence?\nWe asked some etiquette experts and business coaches to guide us through the minefield.\nThe first issue for someone organising a business lunch is the choice of restaurant.\n\"You need to find somewhere with a careful balance of ambience,\" says Jenny Flintoft, a leadership consultant based in the north of England.\n\"I tend to favour a restaurant that is buzzy enough that conversations can be had without being overheard in a deathly quiet restaurant, but not one that has lots of background music, as the voice raising makes having a meaningful conversation very difficult.\"\nMs Flintoft also notes the importance of choosing the right dishes.\n\"I personally steer clear of corn on the cob, as it can easily get stuck in teeth,\" she says. \"[I would also avoid] spaghetti or foods with sloppy sauces, or anything that requires a lot of effort to eat, such as shellfish.\n\"During a business luncheon I want to concentrate on my fellow diner, not battling with the meal.\"\nYou also need to bear in mind the ethical or religious food rules that the other person may follow.\nFor example, ordering the foie gras followed by the veal might not be a great idea, and booking a restaurant that specialises in suckling pig could cause offence.\nWhen you have reserved a table in a hopefully appropriate restaurant, one of the biggest questions that lunchtime is - to drink, or not to drink?\nBritish etiquette expert Jo Bryant says that alcohol is best avoided because the social atmosphere of a restaurant \"can easily let us forget that the lunch is for business purposes\".\nShe continues: \"Add in a glass or two and you might be at risk of relaxing too much, and saying or agreeing to do something you might regret.\n\"It is important to stay sharp and maintain your professional gloss.\"\nHowever, London-based business coach Phil Jones suggests a middle ground when it comes to the wine list. \"Allow the other person to take the lead,\" he says. \"Sometimes it is a loosening of the collar.\n\"It's a chance to get some deeper issues, to speak a bit freer.\"\nEven without alcohol, conversations over a business lunch can all too easily go awry.\nMs Flintoft says: \"Some people launch very quickly into diatribes about a particular hot [political] potato, and there's a lot of those around at the moment, which makes me question their judgement.\n\"But there needs to be a good mix of genuine conversation versus pitching.\"\nMs Nuttall says there should be a number of \"no-fly\" discussions. \"There should be absolutely no talking about sex, politics, religion, bad talking other people or companies, or negatives about your own company or theirs.\"\nMr Jones says people should also guard against venting any personal problems they might be struggling with.\n\"One man's wife was having an affair, and I was the first person he'd confided in,\" he says.\n\"I was given the role of therapist by someone who was a complete stranger to me.\"\nWherever the lunch, and whatever the topic, William Hanson, a UK etiquette coach advises being mindful of the other person's time.\n\"The worst ones are where they drag on and your host thinks you don't have anywhere else to be,\" he says.\nWhen it comes to picking up the tab at the end of the meal Mr Hanson has a simple rule.\n\"Whoever extended the invitation, and has made the reservation, pays,\" he says.\nTo avoid any awkwardness or uncertainty when the bill arrives, Mr Hanson suggests that the inviter goes one stage further, and gives his or her credit card details to the restaurant ahead of the meal.\n\"It takes away the nasty money dilemma at the end,\" he says.\nMr Hanson takes a more relaxed approach though if a lunch with a particular client or associate becomes a regular event. Under such circumstances he says that a \"turn-taking arrangement can often be struck\".\nMs Nuttall adds that she often thinks that if one of the parties has travelled a long distance, they should be treated to lunch.

So, what's the best answer to the question?\nAnswer:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The best answer to the question \"What kind of animal sometimes gets hiccups?\" would be mammals. Mammals are a diverse group of animals that includes humans, dogs, cats, elephants, and many others. One of the defining characteristics of mammals is that they breathe with the help of a diaphragm, a muscle located below the lungs that plays a crucial role in the process of respiration.\n\nHiccups, on the other hand, are involuntary contractions or spasms of the diaphragm muscle. They occur when the diaphragm suddenly contracts, causing a sudden intake of breath that is then abruptly stopped by the closure of the vocal cords, resulting in the characteristic \"hic\" sound.\n\nWhile hiccups can occur in humans, they can also affect other mammals. Dogs, for example, are known to experience hiccups from time to time. It is believed that hiccups in mammals serve a similar purpose as they do in humans, which is to help regulate the respiratory system and potentially remove any irritants or blockages in the airways.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided by the teacher, it can be concluded that mammals are the kind of animal that sometimes gets hiccups. The diaphragm's role in respiration and the fact that hiccups are a result of diaphragm spasms strongly suggest that mammals, with their diaphragmatic breathing, are susceptible to experiencing hiccups."}]}

Which liquid will be closer to its barrel after one minute? (A) the molasses (B) the water  Do not use A and B to answer the question but instead, choose between \"molasses running out of a barrel\" and  \"water running out of a barrel\".\nAnswer:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Based on the given scenario, the molasses running out of a barrel will be closer to its barrel after one minute compared to the water running out of a barrel. This is because the molasses runs out at a crawling pace, which means it flows out slowly and steadily, while the water runs out at a gushing pace, which means it flows out rapidly and forcefully.\n\nThe rate at which a liquid flows out of a barrel depends on several factors such as the viscosity of the liquid, the size of the hole or opening in the barrel, and the pressure inside the barrel. In this case, the molasses has a higher viscosity than water, which means it is thicker and flows more slowly. On the other hand, water has a lower viscosity and flows more easily.\n\nAdditionally, the size of the hole or opening in the barrel can also affect the rate of flow. If the hole in the molasses barrel is smaller than the hole in the water barrel, then the molasses will flow out even more slowly. However, if the hole in the water barrel is larger, then the water will flow out even more rapidly.\n\nTherefore, based on the given scenario, it can be concluded that the molasses running out of a barrel will be closer to its barrel after one minute compared to the water running out of a barrel."}]}

Otherwise, they are going to take away your tax cuts. They are going to take away your Second Amendment rights,\" Trump warned the crowd. Though Trump easily won the district in 2016, Lamb appears to be competitive in part because he is a moderate-to-conservative Democrat who personally opposes abortion and any new gun control measures. Lamb is hoping to pull off an upset with help from former Vice President Joe Biden. \"Passion and commitment rules in politics. Passion and commitment generates grass-roots support,\" Biden told a recent Lamb rally.

The story is about a lawsuit concerning injuries caused by a defective automobile. The suit takes on a personal dimension because the injured plaintiff's attorney, Jedediah Tucker Ward discovers that the automobile manufacturer's attorney is his estranged daughter Maggie Ward. Jedediah Ward is a liberal civil rights lawyer who has based his career on helping people avoid being taken for a ride by the rich and powerful; he's pursued principle at the expense of profit, though he has a bad habit of not following up on his clients after their cases are settled. Jed's daughter, Maggie, has had a bad relationship with her father ever since she discovered that he was cheating on her mother, Estelle, and while she also has made a career in law, she has taken a very different professional route by working for a high-powered corporate law firm and has adopted a self-interested political agenda. Jed is hired to help field a lawsuit against a major auto manufacturer whose station wagons have a dangerous propensity to explode on impact while making a left turn, but while his research indicates he has an all but airtight case against them, the case becomes more complicated for him when he discovers that Maggie is representing the firm he's suing. The auto manufacturer in the film also utilizes a \"bean-counting\" approach to risk management, whereby the projections of actuaries for probable deaths and injured car-owners is weighed against the cost of re-tooling and re-manufacturing the car without the defect (exploding gas tanks) with the resulting decision to keep the car as-is to positively benefit short term profitability.\nThe answer is:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The first name of the person who discovers that their daughter is representing the firm he's suing is Jedediah."}]}

Britain's declaration of war against Nazi Germany in September 1939 included the Crown colonies and India but did not automatically commit the Dominions of Australia, Canada, New Zealand, Newfoundland and South Africa. All soon declared war on Germany, but Ireland chose to remain legally neutral throughout the war.After the Fall of France in June 1940, Britain and the empire stood alone against Germany, until the German invasion of Greece on 7 April 1941. British Prime Minister Winston Churchill successfully lobbied President Franklin D. Roosevelt for military aid from the United States, but Roosevelt was not yet ready to ask Congress to commit the country to war. In August 1941, Churchill and Roosevelt met and signed the Atlantic Charter, which included the statement that \"the rights of all peoples to choose the form of government under which they live\" should be respected. This wording was ambiguous as to whether it referred to European countries invaded by Germany and Italy, or the peoples colonised by European nations, and would later be interpreted differently by the British, Americans, and nationalist movements.In December 1941, Japan launched, in quick succession, attacks on British Malaya, the United States naval base at Pearl Harbor, and Hong Kong.

Therefore, the amount of salt removed from the water is directly proportional to the amount of calcite dissolved, and if less calcite is dissolved, less salt will be removed from the water."}]}

Creative inspiration for the album came from a new direction: without Epstein's guiding presence, the group had briefly turned to Maharishi Mahesh Yogi as their guru. At his ashram in Rishikesh, India, a \"Guide Course\" scheduled for three months marked one of their most prolific periods, yielding numerous songs including a majority of the 30 included on the album. However, Starr left after only ten days, likening it to Butlins, and McCartney eventually grew bored and departed a month later. For Lennon and Harrison, creativity turned to questioning when an electronics technician known as Magic Alex suggested that the Maharishi was attempting to manipulate them. When he alleged that the Maharishi had made sexual advances to women attendees, a persuaded Lennon left abruptly just two months into the course, bringing an unconvinced Harrison and the remainder of the group's entourage with him. In anger, Lennon wrote a scathing song titled \"Maharishi\", renamed \"Sexy Sadie\" to avoid potential legal issues. McCartney said, \"We made a mistake. We thought there was more to him than there was.\"During recording sessions for the White Album, which stretched from late May to mid-October 1968, relations between the Beatles grew openly divisive. Starr quit for two weeks, and McCartney took over the drum kit for \"Back in the U.S.S.R.\" (on which Harrison and Lennon drummed as well) and \"Dear Prudence\". Lennon had lost interest in collaborating with McCartney, whose contribution \"Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da\" he scorned as \"granny music shit\". Tensions were further aggravated by Lennon's romantic preoccupation with avant-garde artist Yoko Ono, whom he insisted on bringing to the sessions despite the group's well-established understanding that girlfriends were not allowed in the studio. Describing the double album, Lennon later said: \"Every track is an individual track; there isn't any Beatle music on it.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Please answer the following question: Emotional eating is when people use food as a way to deal with feelings instead of to satisfy hunger. We've all been there, finishing a whole bag of chips out of boredom or eating cookie after cookie while  _ for a big test. But when done a lot -- especially without realizing it -- emotional eating can affect weight, health, and overall well-being. Not many of us make the connection between eating and our feelings. But understanding what drives emotional eating can help people take steps to change it. One of the biggest myths about emotional eating is that it's prompted by negative feelings. Yes, people often turn to food when they're stressed out, lonely, sad, anxious, or bored. But emotional eating can be linked to positive feelings too, like the romance of sharing dessert on Valentine's Day or the celebration of a holiday feast. Sometimes emotional eating is tied to major life events, like a death or a divorce. More often, though, it's the countless little daily stresses that cause someone to seek comfort or distraction in food. Emotional eating patterns can be learned: A child who is given candy after a big achievement may grow up using candy as a reward for a job well done. A kid who is given cookies as a way to stop crying may learn to link cookies with comfort. We're all emotional eaters to some extent. But for some people, emotional eating can be a real problem, causing serious weight gain or cycles of binging and purging. The trouble with emotional eating (apart from the health issues) is that once the pleasure of eating is gone, the feelings that cause it remain. And you often may feel worse about eating the amount or type of food you did. That's why it helps to know the differences between physical hunger and emotional hunger. Next time you reach for a snack, check in and see which type of hunger is driving it. Which of the following is NOT true about emotional eating? A) It is usually linked to positive or negative feelings. B) It is sometimes linked to major life events. C) It is caused by physical hunger. D) It can cause health problems.\nAnswer:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "C) It is caused by physical hunger."}]}

James, a wildlife writer, told a story that an African woman had placed her baby in the shade of a tree while she was working. An elephant group walked by and saw the baby. Several elephants pulled leafy branches from the tree covered the sleeping baby. Flies can be a problem in Africa and the branches protected the baby from the flies. The elephants were so gentle and quiet that they did not even wake up the baby. Then the elephants walked away.    An English magazine offers another story. Bill, a cat, stayed at home while its master was away on a trip, but the man was injured in a railway accident and died a few days later in a hospital. At the funeral, the Man's brother was surprised to see that Bill was there. The faithful cat had traveled a long way to the hospital, looked at the coffin , and then sadly returned home.    Humans are only one part of the earth. The beautiful flowers are our sisters; the deer, the horses and the great eagles, these are our brothers. The sky and mountains, the cows and men, all belong to the same family. These stories, I hope, will inspire more people to treat animals as our friends rather than pets or our next meal.

Delighted, Parnell returns to the car and relays the address to his partner, but recklessly confuses \"Oak Lane\" for \"Oak Way.\"Rainwood arrives at home that evening to find the empty house and cold salad he expected the night before. As Rainwood showers, Parnell and Scalise creep up to the house. After carefully peering inside, they break down the front and back doors and storm into the house while Rainwood uses the hair dryer. Rainwood hears the loud noise and steps out into the hallway, dryer in hand. Amped up by the tense situation and the cocaine, Parnell mistakes the hair dryer for a weapon and shoots Rainwood, seriously wounding him. Scalise enters from the back of the house and quickly realizes that the supposed weapon is a hair dryer....\nA:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "What is Jimmie Rainwood's occupation in the movie where he is mistaken for a threat and shot by rogue narcotics cops?"}]}

The highest run scorer of all time in International cricket, Tendulkar took up cricket at the age of eleven, made his Test debut on 15 November 1989 against Pakistan in Karachi at the age of sixteen, and went on to represent Mumbai domestically and India internationally for close to twenty-four years. He is the only player to have scored one hundred international centuries, the first batsman to score a double century in a ODI, the holder of the record for the most number of runs in both Test and ODI, and the only player to complete more than 30,000 runs in international cricket. In 2002, halfway through his career, Wisden Cricketers' Almanack ranked him the second greatest Test batsman of all time, behind Don Bradman, and the second greatest ODI batsman of all time, behind Viv Richards.\nContext: The drawn series as India toured Australia in 2003-04 saw Tendulkar making his mark in the last Test of the series, with 241 not out from 436 ball by 33 four at strike rate of 55.27 in Sydney, putting India in a virtually unbeatable position. He spend 613 minute at crease.India have a first inning score of 705/7. He followed up the innings with an unbeaten 60 in the second innings of the Test. Prior to this Test match, he had had an unusually horrible run of form, failing in all six innings in the preceding three Tests. It was no aberration that 2003 was his worst year in Test cricket, with an average of 17.25 and just one fifty.  Tendulkar scored an unbeaten 194 against Pakistan at Multan in the following series. Indian captain Rahul Dravid declared before Tendulkar reached 200; had he done so it would have been the fourth time he had passed the landmark in Tests. Tendulkar said that he was disappointed and that the declaration had taken him by surprise. Many former cricketers commented that Dravid's declaration was in bad taste. After the match, which India won, Dravid said that the matter had been discussed internally and put to rest.  A tennis elbow injury then took its toll on Tendulkar, leaving him out of the side for most of the year, coming back only for the last two Tests when Australia toured India in 2004. He played a part in India's victory in Mumbai in that series with a fast 55, though Australia took the series 2-1.  On 10 December 2005 at Feroz Shah Kotla, Tendulkar scored his record-breaking 35th Test century, against the Sri Lankans. After this, Tendulkar endured the longest spell of his career without a Test century: 17 innings elapsed before he scored 101 against Bangladesh in May 2007. Tendulkar scored his 39th ODI hundred on 6 February 2006 in a match against Pakistan. He followed with a 42 in the second One-Day International against Pakistan on 11 February 2006, and then a 95 in hostile, seaming conditions on 13 February 2006 in Lahore, which set up an Indian victory. On 19 March 2006, after being dismissed for only one run against England in the first innings of the third Test in his home ground, Wankhede, Tendulkar was booed off the ground by a section of the crowd, the first time that he had ever faced such flak. Tendulkar ended the three-Test series without a half-century to his credit, and the need for a shoulder operation raised more questions about his longevity.  Tendulkar's comeback came in the DLF cup in Malaysia and he was the only Indian batsman to shine. In his comeback match, against West Indies on 14 September 2006, Tendulkar responded to his critics who believed that his career was inexorably sliding with his 40th ODI century. Though he scored 141 not out, West Indies won the rain-affected match by the D/L method.\nQuestion: Did they win any trophies while in Australia\n\nAnswer:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The passage does not mention whether India won any trophies while touring Australia in 2003-04.

Both the arcade system and console were powerful for the time and the AES allows for perfect compatibility of games released for the MVS. However, the high price point for both the AES console and its games prevented it from directly competing with its contemporaries, the Sega Mega Drive (Genesis), Super NES (Super Famicom), and Turbo-Grafx 16.However the MVS arcade became very successful in stores in Japan and North America.  - Japan (\"Nippon\" or \"Nihon\" ; formally \"\" or \"Nihon-koku\", means \"State of Japan\") is a sovereign island nation in Eastern Asia.

He even assisted students who didn't have enough money to buy their books.  Henry taught me --- and many others he supported --- how to live life to the fullest. Not by skydiving or exploring some foreign countries, but by appreciating where you are in life and valuing those around you.

Intelligence indicates Drugeon was seriously injured in the drone strike on his vehicle in November and immediately driven away for treatment at a location Jihadis felt was secure, L'Express is reporting Wednesday. \n  \n The new information is based in part on monitoring of al Qaeda and Khorasan communications, in additional to human intelligence, the official said.

But recent intelligence changed that assessment. \n  \n RELATED: U.S. strike in Syria reportedly kills key bomb-maker \n  \n CNN's reporting last month indicated Drugeon's knowledge of explosives, European background and access to Western fighters makes him arguably one of the most dangerous operatives in the global al Qaeda network. \n  \n Drugeon was born in 1989 in a blue-collar and immigrant neighborhood dotted with social housing on the outskirts of Vannes on the Atlantic coast of Brittany, according to Eric Pelletier a reporter with L'Express who has extensively reported on Drugeon and shared his findings with CNN. \n  \n By all accounts, Drugeon had a very normal childhood. His father was a bus driver and his mother a secretary and committed Catholic. \n  \n He had an elder brother who shared his passion for the French soccer team Olympic Marseilles and he got good grades at school. But like a significant number of others who later took the path to radicalization, his parents' divorce when he was 13 was traumatic. \n  \n Drugeon began acting out, and his grades at school nosedived. He began hanging out with a group of young Muslims in the neighborhood who espoused a fundamentalist interpretation of Islam. Before he turned 14 he converted, changing his name to Daoud. \n  \n By 2010, Drugeon was on the radar screen of French security services and had made several trips to Egypt to learn Arabic and more about Islam. He funded the trips by taking driving jobs. In April that year, he slipped away from France for good, traveling via Cairo for the tribal areas of Pakistan, to join the jihad against U.S. forces in Afghanistan. |||||\n\nWrite a summary."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "David Drugeon, a French jihadist and bomb maker for the al-Qaeda affiliated Khorasan Group, is believed to have survived a US drone strike in Syria last month, according to US officials.

Born in Nuremberg, Durer established his reputation and influence across Europe when he was still in his twenties, due to his high-quality woodcut prints. He was in communication with the major Italian artists of his time, including Raphael, Giovanni Bellini and Leonardo da Vinci, and from 1512 he was patronized by emperor Maximilian I. His vast body of work includes engravings, his preferred technique in his later prints, altarpieces, portraits and self-portraits, watercolours and books. The woodcuts, such as the Apocalypse series (1498), retain a more Gothic flavour than the rest of his work. His well-known engravings include the Knight, Death, and the Devil (1513), Saint Jerome in his Study (1514) and Melencolia I (1514), which has been the subject of extensive analysis and interpretation.

The Inner Harbor is located at the mouth of Jones Falls, creating the wide and short northwest branch of the Patapsco River. The district includes any water west of a line drawn between the foot of President Street and the American Visionary Art Museum.  - A central business district (CBD) is the commercial and business centre of a city. In larger cities, it is often synonymous with the city's \"financial district\". Geographically, it often coincides with the \"city centre\" or \"downtown\", but the two concepts are separate: many cities have a central \"business\" district located away from its commercial or cultural city centre or downtown. Both the CBD and the city centre or downtown may also coincide with the central activities district.  - A one-way pair, one-way couple, or just couplet is a pair of parallel, usually one-way streets that carry opposite directions of a signed route or major traffic flow, or sometimes opposite directions of a bus or streetcar route.  - Jonestown is a neighborhood in the southeastern district of Baltimore . Its boundaries are the north side of Pratt Street , the west side of Central Avenue , the east side of Fallsway , and the south side of Orleans Street . The neighborhood lies north of the Little Italy , south of the Oldtown , west of the Washington Hill , and east of the Downtown Baltimore neighborhoods . Jonestown is a historical section of southeast Baltimore established in 1732 that was laid out on 10 acres ( 40,000 m2 ) divided into twenty lots on the east side of the Jones Falls . The district is a mix of industrial , commercial and residential buildings . In the last half of the 20th century , Jonestown has shifted from a predominantly Eastern European and Jewish neighborhood into a predominantly African American neighborhood . Public housing replaced many of the former rowhomes and townhouses throughout the area , though a historical presence is still felt . In the early 2000s , though , modern row housing replaced the public housing . Jonestown is home to Baltimore 's central post office in addition to 8 Baltimore City Landmarks including the Flag House and the Phoenix Shot Tower , both Registered National Historic Landmarks .  - Patterson Park is an urban park in Southeast Baltimore, Maryland, United States, adjacent to the neighborhoods of Canton, Highlandtown, Patterson Park, and Butchers Hill.

It forms a one-way pair of streets with Lombard Street that run westeast through downtown Baltimore. For most of their route, Pratt Street is one-way in an eastbound direction, and Lombard Street is one way westbound. Both streets begin in west Baltimore at Frederick Avenue and end in Butcher's Hill at Patterson Park Avenue. Since 2005, these streets have been open to two-way traffic from Broadway until their end at Patterson Park.

Between 1935 and 1950 the number of humpbacks fell from 20,000 to 10,000 and since 1950 the number has fallen to only 6,000. The number of right whales has fallen even faster. In 1935 there were 25,000. The number fell to 6,000 in 1950 and since 1950 the number has fallen to 4,000. Men have always been hunters. Thousands of whales have become victims .

According to the article, in 1935 there were 25,000 right whales, but by 1950 the number had fallen to 6,000. Since 1950, the number has fallen even further to only 4,000. In comparison, the number of humpback whales fell from 20,000 to 10,000 between 1935 and 1950, and since 1950 the number has fallen to only 6,000. Therefore, the decline in the number of right whales has been more rapid than that of humpback whales."}]}

A large structure can no longer be the design of one person but must be the work of many. Modernism and Postmodernism have been criticised by some members of the architectural profession who feel that successful architecture is not a personal, philosophical, or aesthetic pursuit by individualists; rather it has to consider everyday needs of people and use technology to create liveable environments, with the design process being informed by studies of behavioral, environmental, and social sciences.\"?\nAnswer:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "What has happened to the field of architecture since the 1980s?"}]}

Everybody has committed their share of sins that they wish they could take back. But this wasn't one of them, and he resented the implication that it was -- the implication that someone would dare to judge him for something they did not fully understand.

The dead had no opinions, no agendas. They weren't sensitive. The dead did what you fucking told them to do and didn't complain. Right? The living simply did not understand that there were rules. They didn't want to understand something so banal. Someone who didn't take the time to understand the rules had no right to pass judgment on him.

The bombings left 29 people injured in New York City and no one was injured in the New Jersey bombing.\n\nThe manhunt for Rahami began on Monday morning after the FBI released a wanted poster with his photo and urged the public to come forward with any information about his whereabouts. Rahami was eventually located in Linden, New Jersey, after a resident spotted him sleeping in a doorway and called the police.\n\nWhen police arrived on the scene, Rahami allegedly opened fire, injuring two officers before he was taken into custody. He was then transported to a hospital for treatment of his injuries.\n\nThe capture of Rahami is a significant development in the investigation into the bombings, which have been labeled as acts of terrorism by authorities. The FBI and other law enforcement agencies have been working around the clock to track down the suspect and prevent any further attacks.\n\nThe motive behind the bombings is still unclear, but authorities have not ruled out the possibility of a connection to international terrorism. The investigation is ongoing, and authorities are urging the public to remain vigilant and report any suspicious activity.\n\nIn the wake of the bombings, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio and New York Governor Andrew Cuomo have both praised the efforts of law enforcement and first responders, and have urged New Yorkers to remain calm and vigilant.\n\nThe capture of Rahami is a reminder of the ongoing threat of terrorism, both at home and abroad. It is a testament to the bravery and dedication of law enforcement officers who put their lives on the line every day to protect our communities.\n\nAs the investigation continues, we must remain vigilant and work together to prevent any further acts of violence. We must also remember that we are a resilient and united nation, and that we will not be intimidated by those who seek to do us harm."}]}

However, after the traumatic experience of being robbed at gunpoint in Paris, it seems that her perspective may have shifted.\n\nIn the interview, Kardashian stated that she has become accustomed to the constant attention and scrutiny that comes with being a public figure. She acknowledged that her every move is watched and analyzed by the media and the public, but she claimed that she was able to handle it.\n\nKardashian also spoke about the importance of maintaining a certain level of privacy, even in the midst of her fame. She stated that she tries to keep certain aspects of her life private, such as her children and her relationship with her husband, Kanye West.\n\nHowever, the events of the robbery in Paris seem to have shattered Kardashian's sense of security and privacy. The incident, in which she was held at gunpoint and robbed of millions of dollars worth of jewelry, was a stark reminder of the dangers that come with being a celebrity.\n\nSince the robbery, Kardashian has taken steps to increase her security and protect her privacy. She has been more selective about the events she attends and the places she goes, and she has been more cautious about sharing details of her life on social media.\n\nThe incident has also had a profound impact on Kardashian's mental health. In an episode of her reality show, \"Keeping Up With The Kardashians,\" she spoke about the anxiety and fear that she has experienced since the robbery. She has sought therapy to help her cope with the trauma and has been open about her struggles with her fans.\n\nIn conclusion, while Kim Kardashian may have once claimed that she could handle the lack of privacy that comes with being a celebrity, the events of the robbery in Paris have shown that even the most famous and wealthy individuals are not immune to danger and vulnerability. Kardashian's experience serves as a reminder of the importance of privacy and security, and the need for public figures to take steps to protect themselves and their loved ones."}]}

Robert is livid, both at the news and the method that he found out about the news. There is a second story on the teletype: Max's wife, the famous novelist Paula Wharton (whom Max calls Paulie), is in Hollywood adapting her latest book into a movie screenplay. Max wants to do his duty as a citizen and responsible journalist to be close to the war. Robert's view is that without Max, the newspaper will fold because Max *is* the newspaper. From Hollywood, Paulie telephones Max and congratulates him on his decision. After Max informs her of the plan of basic training then possibly officer's candidate school, Paulie decides that she will move to where ever that school is to be close to him. After completion of basic training, Max sends Paulie a telegram that officer's candidate school is in Tetley Field, Florida. She doesn't quite understand Max's motivations, but she wants to see her husband succeed in this passion. Paulie arrives at Palmetto Court looking for bungalow 26D and meets the last tenant, Jan Lupton, whose husband Roy has just graduated to second lieutenant.

The Customer Settlements group makes every effort to render accurate invoices on a timely basis. Although issued a day after their scheduled posting, the invoices are still being issued within the 5-business days. {I'd forgotten about Labor Day when I set up the schedule.} Transmission Customers will observe adjustments for an error on in May 2000 Settlement  Adjustment  invoices  that  were  issued  in  July. The total adjustment  amounted to $2,081,568.11 and was allocated across 2,261,753.08 MWh. Customers  may  validate  their  respective adjustments by computing their  ratio  shares  of  the  $2,081,568.11  using  2,261,753  MWh  as the denominator  in  their respective ratios of their May 2000 load. The reason the  denominator of the ratio share appears small is because the pay out of this  adjustment is to the Transmission Owners. In order not to assess the TO's  a  proportionate  share  of the $2,081,568.11, which would defeat the purpose  of  the  adjustment, their withdrawals have been excluded from the ratio share. Transmission Owners should observe a credit on their invoices based upon their respective megawatt-mile coefficients for the period. With  regard  to  the  November 1999 & December 1999 settlement adjustments that  were  scheduled  to  be issued on the 7th, the NYISO intends to issue those  invoices  next  week. The issuance dates will ensure that customers will have at least 5 business days to review the invoices prior to payments being due to the NYISO. If necessary, the NYISO will reschedule settlement dates  for these months should our reconciliations take longer to complete; however, we do not anticipate this at this time. In  addition,  I'd  like to take this opportunity to clarify a point that I made  in  a  TIE  posting  regarding  the  rebilling  of  the  August  25th settlements. The  initial  billing runs for August 25th were done without considering  ConEd's  sub-zonal  load. As a result, it appeared as though there  was no load in the ConEd sub-zones on the 25th and all DAM purchases and  bilateral transactions in those sub-zones were sold back to the market in  real  time  causing  the  Schedule  1 residual adjustment to be grossly inflated. The reason this occurred was due to what appears to have been a frame  relay  problem  between the NYISO & ConEd resulting in the NYISO not receiving a file from ConEd. By no means was my email notification of this event  to  imply that ConEd was not complying with the daily load provision process. This was merely a hardware/communications issue.

This is a natural adaptation that occurs during hibernation, which is a state of reduced metabolic activity that allows animals to conserve energy during periods of food scarcity or harsh environmental conditions. During hibernation, the animal's body processes slow down, including its heart rate and breathing rate, which reduces the amount of energy it needs to survive. As a result, the animal's metabolism shifts from burning stored fat to burning stored glycogen, which is a slower process that helps to conserve energy. This slower metabolism also means that the animal loses weight more slowly than usual, as it is not burning through its fat stores as quickly. This adaptation allows animals to survive for extended periods without food, and to emerge from hibernation in good condition, ready to resume their normal activities."}]}

Its ten provinces and three territories extend from the Atlantic to the Pacific and northward into the Arctic Ocean, covering , making it the world's second-largest country by total area and the fourth-largest country by land area. Canada's border with the United States is the world's longest land border. The majority of the country has a cold or severely cold winter climate, but southerly areas are warm in summer. Canada is sparsely populated, the majority of its land territory being dominated by forest and tundra and the Rocky Mountains.

Unqualified, the word \"football\" is understood to refer to whichever form of football is the most popular in the regional context in which the word appears. Sports commonly called 'football' in certain places include: association football (known as soccer in some countries); gridiron football (specifically American football or Canadian football); Australian rules football; rugby football (either rugby league or rugby union); and Gaelic football.

The offense, the team with control of the oval-shaped football, attempts to advance down the field by running with or passing the ball, while the team without control of the ball, the defense, aims to stop their advance and take control of the ball for themselves. The offense must advance at least ten yards in four downs, or plays, or else they turn over the football to the opposing team; if they succeed, they are given a new set of four downs. Points are primarily scored by advancing the ball into the opposing team's end zone for a touchdown or kicking the ball through the opponent's goalposts for a field goal.

Despite this, the Tibetan government in exile, which is based in India, has stated that it did not support the disruption of the Olympic torch relay. Overall, the official name of the bodyguards of the torch runner is the \"Olympic Holy Flame Protection Unit\", but their presence was not allowed during the torch relay in India due to political tensions."}]}

He was among the four sons and three daughters of Khansaahib Ameer Ahmed Khan and Mehmoodah Begum. His father, a police inspector, was inspired by the reformist thinking of Syed Ahmed Khan. In his early age, Khan's mother introduced him to the poetry of Maulana Hali and Muhammad Iqbal, the sermons of Abul Kalam Azad, and the Sufist philosophy of Rumi.\nContext: The Orangi poverty alleviation project (known as the Orangi Pilot Project, or OPP) was initiated by Khan as an NGO in 1980. Orangi is located on the northwest periphery of Karachi. At that time, it was the largest of the city's approximately 650 low-income squatter settlements (known as katchi abadi). The locality was first developed in 1963 as a government township of 5 square kilometres (1,236 acres). The influx of migrants after the creation of Bangladesh swelled the settlement to about one million people crowded over an area of more than 32 square kilometres (7,907 acres). The working class multi-ethnic population was predominantly composed of day labourers, skilled workers, artisans, small shopkeepers, peddlers and low-income white collar workers. The project proved an impetus to the socio-economic development of the population of the area. As the project director, Khan proved to be a dynamic and innovative leader. The project initially focused on creating a system of underground sewers, using local materials and labour, and succeeded in laying hundreds of kilometres of drainage pipes along with auxiliary facilities. Within a decade of the initiative, local residents had established schools, health clinics, women's work centres, cooperative stores and a credit organisation to finance enterprise projects. By 1993, OPP had managed to provide low-cost sewers to more than 72,000 houses. The project subsequently diversified into a number of programmes, including a people's financed and managed low-cost sanitation programme; a housing programme; a basic health and family planning programme; a programme of supervised credit for small family enterprise units; an education programme; and a rural development programme in the nearby villages.  Comparing the OPP with Comilla project, Akhter Hameed Khan once commented:  The Orangi Pilot Project was very different from the Comilla Academy. OPP was a private body, dependent for its small fixed budget on another NGO. The vast resources and support of the government, Harvard advisors, MSU, and Ford Foundation was missing. OPP possessed no authority, no sanctions. It may observe and investigate but it could only advise, not enforce.  The successful OPP model became an inspiration for other municipalities around the country. In 1999, Khan helped to create Lodhran Pilot Project (LPP) to collaborate with Lodhran municipal committee. Learning from past experiences, the project extended its scope to the whole town instead of concentrating on low-income settlements only. The municipal partnership was itself a new initiative that ensured wider civic co-operation.  The success of OPP did come at a cost for Dr Khan as his liberal views and self-help initiatives were questioned and criticised by certain interest groups. At two occasions, he was accused of blasphemy. However, all allegations against him were acquitted by the courts of law and cleared by independent religious scholars.\nQuestion: Was it a sucess\n\nAnswer:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yes, the Orangi Pilot Project (OPP) initiated by Akhter Hameed Khan was a success.

Also on television, he starred in the Fox series \"The Following\" from 2013 to 2015. Bacon has won a Golden Globe Award and three Screen Actors Guild Awards, and was nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award. \"The Guardian\" named him one of the best actors never to have received an Academy Award nomination. In 2003, Bacon received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.  - A parlour or parlor game is a group game played indoors. During the Victorian era in Great Britain and in the United States, these games were extremely popular among the upper and middle classes. They were often played in a parlour, hence the name.  - A Few Good Men is a 1992 American legal drama film directed by Rob Reiner and starring Tom Cruise, Jack Nicholson, and Demi Moore, with Kevin Bacon, Kevin Pollak, Wolfgang Bodison, James Marshall, J. T. Walsh and Kiefer Sutherland in supporting roles. It was adapted for the screen by Aaron Sorkin from his play of the same name but includes contributions by William Goldman.

The stars are permanent public monuments to achievement in the entertainment industry, bearing the names of a mix of actors, musicians, directors, producers, musical and theatrical groups, fictional characters, and others. The Walk of Fame is administered by the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce and maintained by the self-financing Hollywood Historic Trust. It is a popular tourist destination, with a reported 10 million visitors in 2003.  - Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon is a parlour game based on the \"six degrees of separation\" concept, which posits that any two people on Earth are six or fewer acquaintance links apart. Movie buffs challenge each other to find the shortest path between an arbitrary actor and prolific character actor Kevin Bacon. It rests on the assumption that anyone involved in the Hollywood film industry can be linked through their film roles to Bacon within six steps. The game requires a group of players to try to connect any such individual to Kevin Bacon as quickly as possible and in as few links as possible. In 2007, Bacon started a charitable organization named SixDegrees.org.  - Hollywood (, informally Tinseltown ) is an ethnically diverse, densely populated, relatively low-income neighborhood in the central region of Los Angeles, California.

Interpretation occurs even when the actor is \"playing themselves\", as in some forms of experimental performance art, or, more commonly; to act, is to create, a character in performance.  - Sleepers is a 1996 American legal crime drama film written, produced, and directed by Barry Levinson, and based on Lorenzo Carcaterra's 1995 novel of the same name.

The term, often contrasted with that of leading actor, is somewhat abstract and open to interpretation.

It was released in October 2008 as the first single from the album Dean Brody . The song is a mid-tempo ballad about the relationship between two brothers , where one of them is going to war . `` Brothers '' received positive reviews from critics for its content and stark contrast to other country songs on the radio . The song peaked in the Top 10 of the Radio & Records Country Singles chart in Canada and number 76 on the Canadian Hot 100 . It also reached the Top 30 on the Billboard Hot Country Songs chart in the United States .  - Country music is a genre of United States popular music that originated in the southern United States in the 1920s. It takes its roots from the southeastern genre of United States, such as folk music (especially Appalachian folk music), and blues music. Blues modes have been used extensively throughout its recorded history. Country music often consists of ballads and dance tunes with generally simple forms and harmonies accompanied by mostly string instruments such as banjos, electric and acoustic guitars, dobros and fiddles as well as harmonicas. According to Lindsey Starnes, the term \"country music\" gained popularity in the 1940s in preference to the earlier term \"hillbilly music\"; it came to encompass Western music, which evolved parallel to hillbilly music from similar roots, in the mid-20th century. The term \"country music\" is used today to describe many styles and subgenres. The origins of country music are the folk music of working-class Americans, who blended popular songs, Irish and Celtic fiddle tunes, traditional English ballads, and cowboy songs, and various musical traditions from European immigrant communities. In 2009 country music was the most listened to rush hour radio genre during the evening commute, and second most popular in the morning commute in the United States.  - Dean Brody (born August 12, 1975) is a Canadian country music artist. Originally signed to Broken Bow Records in 2008, Brody made his debut later that year with the single \"Brothers\". This song, a Top 40 country hit in the US, was the first single from his self-titled debut album, released in 2009 under the production of Matt Rovey. In 2010, Brody was signed to Open Road Recordings and released his second album, \"Trail in Life\". In 2012, he released his third album, \"Dirt\", earning the 2012 CCMA Album of the Year award and a 2013 Juno nomination for Country Album of the Year. Brody also won the 2012 and 2013 CCMA Male Artist of the Year award. Brody's fourth album, \"Crop Circles\", was released in 2013.

Douglas set about introducing more squadrons and dispersing the few GL sets to create a carpet effect in the southern counties. Still, in February 1941, there remained only seven squadrons with 87 pilots, under half the required strength. The GL carpet was supported by six GCI sets controlling radar-equipped night-fighters. By the height of the Blitz, they were becoming more successful. The number of contacts and combats rose in 1941, from 44 and two in 48 sorties in January 1941, to 204 and 74 in May (643 sorties). But even in May, 67% of the sorties were visual cat's-eye missions. Curiously, while 43% of the contacts in May 1941 were by visual sightings, they accounted for 61% of the combats. Yet when compared with Luftwaffe daylight operations, there was a sharp decline in German losses to 1%. If a vigilant bomber crew could spot the fighter first, they had a decent chance at evading it.\".

You could never tell by someone's last name who spoke your language (For instance, my good friend P. Arsenault spoke the Queen's English and my cousin Sean Doyle wouldn't have recognized an Oxford Dictionary if you shoved up his nose). As children, we were segregated by language; all the French-speaking kids went to one side of the school where they spoke French all the time. I was fortunate enough to be sent to the English side of the school and got to speak my native tongue. My parents decided my brother and sister wouldn't be quite so lucky. In an effort to bridge the great language divide, they both spent six years learning everything in French and mingling with the French people (My parents did this because it was the firm belief of all forward-thinking families that whatever road you took would be much smoother if you could speak both of Canada's official languages.

The Congress' stated position was that the princely states were not sovereign entities, and as such could not opt to be independent notwithstanding the end of paramountcy. The princely states must therefore accede to either India or Pakistan. In July 1946, Nehru pointedly observed that no princely state could prevail militarily against the army of independent India. In January 1947, he said that independent India would not accept the divine right of kings, and in May 1947, he declared that any princely state which refused to join the Constituent Assembly would be treated as an enemy state. Other Congress leaders, such as C. Rajagopalachari, argued that as paramountcy \"came into being as a fact and not by agreement\", it would necessarily pass to the government of independent India, as the successor of the British.Patel and Menon, who were charged with the actual job of negotiating with the princes, took a more conciliatory approach than Nehru. The official policy statement of the Government of India made by Patel on 5 July 1947 made no threats. Instead, it emphasised the unity of India and the common interests of the princes and independent India, reassured them about the Congress' intentions, and invited them to join independent India \"to make laws sitting together as friends than to make treaties as aliens\". He reiterated that the States Department would not attempt to establish a relationship of domination over the princely states. Unlike the Political Department of the British Government, it would not be an instrument of paramountcy, but a medium whereby business could be conducted between the states and India as equals.  answer the following question:  Who declared that any princely state which refused to join the Constituent Assembly would be treated as an enemy state\nAnswer:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Nehru declared that any princely state which refused to join the Constituent Assembly would be treated as an enemy state."}]}

Another rental car, another unfamiliar highway, another string of e-mails sent from his BlackBerry while driving 70 mph. Bird took a sip from his coffee and looked over at Dan Grandone, a co-worker riding in the passenger seat.\n\n\"I don't know about you, but I'm running on adrenaline right now,\" Bird said. \"I love this feeling that we're on the verge of something crucial.\"\n\nBird had lived at that precipice ever since joining Barack Obama's campaign as a top organizer in 2007, but rarely had he faced a challenge so daunting as the one awaiting in Racine. As deputy director of Organizing for America, a national network of Obama supporters, Bird was scheduled to speak with a group of volunteers who had been threatened at town halls, outshouted at local rallies and weakened by a general sense of post-campaign fatigue. With one 90-minute visit, Bird hoped to leave them confident, empowered and reenergized.\n\n\"We want these people to feel like they can control almost anything that happens in government,\" said Bird, who had traveled from his office at Democratic National Committee headquarters in Washington to spend two days visiting volunteers across Wisconsin. \"They should feel like there's no barrier between the regular people out in the states and the power players in D.C.\"\n\nThe outcome of the health-care debate weighed partially on Bird's success, and on the effectiveness of Organizing for America (OFA) in general. When Bird was named deputy director of OFA last year, he became the vanguard of much more than 13 million e-mail addresses collected from supporters during Obama's campaign. He became one of the people most responsible for validating Obama's campaign ethos: that grass-roots support can power government and shape legislation.\n\nIt is a theory that now faces a defining test. Conservatives have waged an angry and effective battle against Obama's health-care legislation, and OFA has responded by asking its volunteers to visit congressional offices and flood town hall meetings in a massive show of support. This month, Obama sent an e-mail to OFA members: \"This is the moment our movement was built for,\" he wrote.\n\nWhen Bird arrived at a Racine coffee shop called Cup of Hope and sat down with 10 OFA volunteers, he spoke with similar urgency.\n\n\"We need to flex our muscles on this, and we need to act fast,\" he said. \"We always said in the campaign that this was not just about one election but about a chance to make some major changes. Well, here's the chance.\"\n\nBird had a lifetime of experience thriving against long odds, and he relished the role. The son of conservative Baptists, Bird grew up in a Missouri trailer park before attending Harvard Divinity School. He organized underfunded schools in Boston, worked for Howard Dean's presidential campaign in 2004 and started a company that lobbied Wal-Mart -- his mother's former employer -- to improve its benefits and wages. On behalf of Obama, he had moved to five states, helping the candidate overcome racism in South Carolina and Islamophobia in Pennsylvania and Ohio.\n\nWhen Bird arrived in Wisconsin last week, he recognized all the familiar hallmarks of an underdog fight. Gone were the 44 field offices across the state where Obama organizers had worked during the campaign; now Bird spent his visit searching for power outlets in Wisconsin coffee shops and conducting conference calls at sidewalk cafes.

During the 1750s  Messiah was performed increasingly at festivals and cathedrals throughout the country. Individual choruses and arias were occasionally extracted for use as anthems or motets in church services, or as concert pieces, a practice that grew in the 19th century and has continued ever since. After Handel's death, performances were given in Florence (1768), New York (excerpts, 1770), Hamburg (1772), and Mannheim (1777), where Mozart first heard it. For the performances in Handel's lifetime and in the decades following his death, the musical forces used in the Foundling Hospital performance of 1754 are thought by Burrows to be typical. A fashion for large-scale performances began in 1784, in a series of commemorative concerts of Handel's music given in Westminster Abbey under the patronage of King George III. A plaque on the Abbey wall records that \"The Band consisting of DXXV [525] vocal & instrumental performers was conducted by Joah Bates Esqr.\" In a 1955 article, Sir Malcolm Sargent, a proponent of large-scale performances, wrote, \"Mr Bates ... had known Handel well and respected his wishes. The orchestra employed was two hundred and fifty strong, including twelve horns, twelve trumpets, six trombones and three pairs of timpani (some made especially large).\" In 1787 further performances were given at the Abbey; advertisements promised, \"The Band will consist of Eight Hundred Performers\".In continental Europe, performances of Messiah were departing from Handel's practices in a different way: his score was being drastically reorchestrated to suit contemporary tastes. In 1786, Johann Adam Hiller presented Messiah with updated scoring in Berlin Cathedral. In 1788 Hiller presented a performance of his revision with a choir of 259 and an orchestra of 87 strings, 10 bassoons, 11 oboes, 8 flutes, 8 horns, 4 clarinets, 4 trombones, 7 trumpets, timpani, harpsichord and organ.

Five years on, a weekly 90-minute drive from their downtown apartment to the house has long been the norm. They enjoy gardening, barbecuing or simply relaxing in their getaway surrounded by mountains -- but often shrouded in Beijing's infamous smog. Yes, the couple's three-bedroom weekend home lies on the outskirts of the Chinese capital -- thousands of miles away from the original Jackson Hole valley in the U.S. state of Wyoming, which is known for its breathtaking natural beauty. The Chinese Jackson Hole is more crowded, containing some 1,000 single-family houses inspired by rustic lodges in the American frontier. Still, wealthy locals are lured to this sprawling development by the promise of living in the \"Wild West.\" After driving past security guards in cowboy outfits patrolling \"Route 66\" on golf carts, Liu's husband Lu Jun pulled over their SUV at the end of a cul-de-sac one recent Sunday. Opening the door to a world of Americana, Liu and Lu -- both lawyers in Beijing -- proudly displayed their fondness for the United States by adding personal touches to the built-in furniture and decoration that evoke the Old West. She studied and worked in Indianapolis for two years from 2003 to 2005, during which time he visited. Adorning the earthy-toned walls are colorful license plates from the U.S. states -- including Wyoming -- they have traveled to and a large framed copy of the American Declaration of Independence. \"We want more freedom,\" said Liu, 40, pointing to the framed copy she bought in Florida. \"This is a milestone -- (we hang it here) partially for the history, partially for our profession.\" \"Many people have been to the United States and enjoy the environment there,\" Lu, 55, added. \"Those who haven't think this place is authentic America and they like it.\" That's proven to be a great selling point for developer Liu Xiangyang since he -- with the help of an American designer -- launched the Jackson Hole project a decade ago. He has sold almost all the houses, and seen the property value double over the years with the bigger homes now fetching $1 million each. Official data shows that a typical urban resident in China earned less than $4,000 in 2012. Annie Liu -- who is not related to the developer -- and her husband feel pleased about their purchase as early believers, and bought a second, bigger house here last year. They say other homeowners share their appreciation for the American culture and values that are reflected in the architecture and setting, despite frequent news reports on rising tensions between the two nations. \"We like the States and we like the lifestyle,\" Liu said. \"Let the governments worry about the things that should be worried about by them.\" Her sentiment echoes the most recent results of an annual survey on Chinese people's attitude towards the United States by the Pew Research Center, a Washington-based think tank. Although the Pew study finds Chinese public perceptions of the United States becoming less favorable in 2012, it notes: \"There is one constant: richer, younger, more educated, and urban Chinese all express a more positive view of (the soft power) aspects of America's image. And this also holds true for overall ratings of the U.S.\" Developer Liu is a fan of the United States as well, overseeing construction for the next phase on his 70-square-kilometer lot -- the size of 13,000 American football fields. His plans include 2,000 townhouses mimicking the feel of Mendocino, a scenic coastal town in northern California, and a winery that he says will rival Napa Valley in ten years. In between sipping wine and chatting with residents at a lunch gathering on site, the 51-year-old businessman from the central Henan province reflects on his corporate mission. \"For those who can afford to buy houses here, they have enough money,\" he explained. \"They want spiritual fulfillment.\" For that, the developer has built a brand new church in the center of his town -- next to a row of small shops, bars and cafes -- serving residents like Annie Liu, who embraced Christianity as a graduate student in the United States. \"This is an 'American' community so it's a necessary element here,\" said Liu as she walked out of the soon-to-open Jackson Hole church. Although she misses the natural beauty and cultural diversity of the United States, Liu says she never hesitated about returning to the motherland because of her and her husband's career aspirations and their roots. Now comfortably settled at work and home back in China, where the Communist leadership is proclaiming national revival as the ultimate Chinese Dream, Liu feels she hasn't completely abandoned the American Dream -- as she and her fellow residents in this fictional U.S. town pursue their freedom and happiness every weekend.\n\nWrite highlights for this article."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "- Annie Liu and her husband bought a log home in Jackson Hole, China, inspired by rustic lodges in the American frontier.\n- The couple added personal touches to the built-in furniture and decoration that evoke the Old West, including colorful license plates from the U.S. states they have traveled to and a large framed copy of the American Declaration of Independence.\n- Developer Liu Xiangyang launched the Jackson Hole project a decade ago, and he has sold almost all the houses, with the bigger homes now fetching $1 million each.\n- The property value has doubled over the years, and Liu plans to build 2,000 townhouses mimicking the feel of Mendocino, a scenic coastal town in northern California, and a winery that he says will rival Napa Valley in ten years.\n- Liu and her husband feel pleased about their purchase as early believers, and bought a second, bigger house here last year.\n- The couple and other homeowners share their appreciation for the American culture and values that are reflected in the architecture and setting, despite frequent news reports on rising tensions between the two nations.\n- Developer Liu has built a brand new church in the center of his town, serving residents like Annie Liu, who embraced Christianity as a graduate student in the United States.\n- Liu feels she hasn't completely abandoned the American Dream -- as she and her fellow residents in this fictional U.S. town pursue their freedom and happiness every weekend."}]}

Most humans have fled the planet, to live on a space station near Io, a moon of Jupiter.  Sam Walden is one of the few humans remaining on Earth. She lives alone at high altitude, where the air is still breathable, trying to raise bees that can survive in the atmosphere. Her intent is to use the bees to eventually clean the air via the pollinization of oxygen-producing plants. Her long-distance boyfriend, who lives on the Io station, urges her to leave Earth on the last shuttle from the planet. A storm creates a toxic cloud that passes through Sam's shelter, apparently killing all of her bees. Micah, a man travelling by helium balloon, arrives shortly thereafter. He intends to reach the launch site and leave Earth, but first wants to speak with Dr. Harry Walden, Sam's father, who had urged mankind to stay because he still saw hope.

A team headed by Professor Marina de Tommaso at the Neurophysiopathology Pain Unit asked a group of men and women to pick the 20 paintings they considered most ugly and most beautiful from a selection of 300 works by artists such as Lenoardo da Vinci and Sandro Botticelli. They were then asked to watch either the beautiful paintings, or the ugly paintings, or a blank panel while the team struck a short laser pulse at their hand, creating a sensation as if they had been hurt by a pin. The subjects rated the pain as being a third less intense while they were viewing the beautiful paintings, compared with when considering the ugly paintings or the blank panel. Electrodes   measuring the brain's electrical activity also confirmed a reduced response to the pain when the subject looked at beautiful paintings. While distractions , such as music, are known to reduce pain in hospital, Prof de Tommaso says this is the first result to show that beauty plays a part. The findings, reported in New Scientist, also go a long way to show that beautiful surroundings could aid the healing process. \"Hospitals have been designed to be functional, but we think that their aesthetic  aspects should be taken into account too,\" said the neurologist. \"Beauty obviously offers a distraction that ugly paintings do not.

If there is no answer, please output \"Insufficient information to provide an answer.\". Movie title: Sicko Context: According to Sicko, almost fifty million Americans are uninsured while the remainder, who are covered, are often victims of insurance company fraud and red tape. Furthermore, Sicko points out that the U.S. health care system is ranked 37 out of 191 by the World Health Organization with certain health measures, such as infant mortality and life expectancy, equal to countries with much less economic wealth.[6] Interviews are conducted with people who thought they had adequate coverage but were denied care. Former employees of insurance companies describe cost-cutting initiatives that give bonuses to insurance company physicians and others to find reasons for the company to avoid meeting the cost of medically necessary treatments for policy holders, and thus increase company profitability. In Canada, a citizen describes the case of Tommy Douglas, who was voted the greatest Canadian in 2004 for his contributions to the Canadian health system. Moore also interviews a microsurgeon and people waiting in the emergency room of a Canadian public hospital. Against the backdrop of the history of the American health care debate, opponents of universal health care are set in the context of 1950s-style anti-communist propaganda. A 1950s record distributed by the American Medical Association, narrated by Ronald Reagan, warns that universal health care could lead to lost freedoms and socialism. In response, Moore shows that socialized public services like police, fire service, the United States Postal Service, public education and community libraries have not led to communism in the United States. The origins of the Health Maintenance Organization Act of 1973 are presented using a taped conversation between John Ehrlichman and President Richard Nixon on February 17, 1971; Ehrlichman is heard telling Nixon that \"...the less care they give them, the more money they make,\" a plan that Nixon remarked \"fine\" and \"not bad.\" This led to the expansion of the modern health maintenance organization-based health care system.

Seymour has no idea what kind of plant it is, but explains how he got it (\"Da Doo\"): While he was shopping for odd new plants, his hobby, a solar eclipse occurred. After daylight returned, the strange plant seemingly appeared out of nowhere. Seymour bought it for cheap and brought it home to examine.

Article: Dear Editor: I have been reading your newspaper, the Hometown Gazette, for the past two years, ever since I moved to Smithville because of my work. We moved here from New York City, so I am used to reading excellent newspapers such as the Washington Post and the New York Times. In fact, we still have the Times delivered on Sundays. All the members of my family enjoy reading the recipes in the magazine, as well as the Styles section. My children are crazy about their sports section.  The Times is great, but the Gazette is another story. I've never read an article that doesn't contain at least three or four spelling or grammatical errors. For example, in last week's issue, you misspelled the word \"secretary\", used a singular verb with a plural noun, and used \"it's\" as a possessive . And that was just in the lead story! In case you never went to elementary school, \"it's\" means \"it is\". It's not a possessive pronoun! In another case, the re-port you gave on an event was completely different from other newspapers. I didn't know what the reason was. It's a pity that this city, Smithville, Wisconsin, has only one newspaper, because I'd like to have an alternative to the newspaper you publish. I find it hard to believe your news stories. If you can't spell correctly, how can you get your facts right?  I've been meaning to get this off my chest for some time. Please cancel my subscription . And buy your-self a dictionary.  Sincerely, Jane Z. Jones Question: What is the writer's attitude towards the Gazette? Answer:\n\nAvailable choices:\n[1]. Angry.;\n[2]. Sympathetic.;\n[3].

The request to cancel the subscription and the suggestion to buy a dictionary further indicate the writer's dissatisfaction and anger towards the Gazette."}]}

Beaker A is sitting on top of a burner that is set to a low temperature, and Beaker X is on a burner with a high temperature. Ken, the scientist studying these compounds, is closely monitoring the chemicals to see what type of changes occur.  But I can use this background: When the temperature of reactants is higher, the rate of the reaction is faster. At higher temperatures, particles of reactants have more energy, so they move faster. As a result, they are more likely to bump into one another and to collide with greater force. For example, food spoils because of chemical reactions, and these reactions occur faster at higher temperatures (see the bread on the left in the Figure below ). This is why we store foods in the refrigerator or freezer (like the bread on the right in the Figure below ). The lower temperature slows the rate of spoilage.  What is an answer for this question: Which beaker will have a slower rate of reaction?\nAnswer:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Based on the given information, it can be inferred that Beaker A, which is sitting on top of a burner set to a low temperature, will have a slower rate of reaction compared to Beaker X, which is on a burner with a high temperature. This is because the rate of a chemical reaction is directly proportional to the temperature of the reactants. At higher temperatures, the particles of the reactants have more energy and move faster, which increases the likelihood of collisions and the force of those collisions. This results in a faster rate of reaction. Conversely, at lower temperatures, the particles of the reactants have less energy and move slower, which decreases the likelihood of collisions and the force of those collisions. This results in a slower rate of reaction. Therefore, since Beaker A is on a burner set to a low temperature, it will have a slower rate of reaction compared to Beaker X, which is on a burner with a high temperature. Ken, the scientist studying these compounds, will closely monitor the chemicals in both beakers to observe the differences in the rate of reaction."}]}

Christine slaps him several times across the face, but he hardly reacts, choosing instead to depart without a word. The next morning, Robert Tisdall (Derrick De Marney) happens to be walking along the seaside cliffs when Christine's body washes ashore. He runs to get help and call the police, but two young swimmers arrive just in time to see him racing away from the corpse. A belt from his raincoat, which had just recently gone missing, is found next to the body, further implicating him in her strangling. He is subsequently arrested and becomes the main suspect, partly because of a large sum of money Christine left to him in her will, a gift he was unaware of.
